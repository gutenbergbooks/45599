<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<hr class="chap" />
<p class="head noindent center">CHAPTER I</p>

<p class="noindent center">INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>Love of flowers and all things green and
growing is with many men and women
a passion so strong that it often seems to be a
sort of primal instinct, coming down through
generation after generation, from the first man
who was put into a garden &#8220;to dress it and to
keep it.&#8221; People whose lives, and those of
their parents before them, have been spent in
dingy tenements, and whose only garden is a
rickety soap-box high up on a fire-escape, share
this love, which must have a plant to tend,
with those whose gardens cover acres and
whose plants have been gathered from all the
countries of the world. How often in summer,
when called to town, and when driving through
the squalid streets to the ferries or riding on
the elevated road, one sees these gardens of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the poor. Sometimes they are only a Geranium
or two, or the gay Petunia. Often a
tall Sunflower, or a Tomato plant red with
fruit. These efforts tell of the love for the
growing things, and of the care that makes
them live and blossom against all odds.
One feels a thrill of sympathy with the
owners of the plants, and wishes that some
day their lot may be cast in happier places,
where they too may have gardens to tend.</p>

<p>It has always seemed to me that the punishment
of the first gardener and his wife was the
bitterest of all. To have lived always in a
garden &#8220;where grew every tree pleasant to the
sight and good for food,&#8221; to have known no
other place, and then to have been driven forth
into the great world without hope of returning!
Oh! Eve, had you not desired wisdom, your
happy children might still be tilling the soil of
that blessed Eden. The first woman longed
for knowledge, as do her daughters of to-day.
When the serpent said that eating of the forbidden
fruit would make them &#8220;as gods,&#8221; what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
wonder that Eve forgot the threatening command
to leave untouched the Tree of Life,
and, burning to be &#8220;wise,&#8221; ate of the fateful
apple and gave it to her Adam? And then, to
leave the lovely place at the loveliest of all
times in a garden, the cool of the day! Faint
sunset hues tinting the sky, the night breeze
gently stirring the trees, Lilies and Roses
giving their sweetest perfume, brilliant Venus
mounting her accustomed path, while the
sleepy twitter of the birds alone breaks the
silence. Then the voice of wrath, the Cherubim,
the turning flaming sword!</p>

<p>Through trials and tribulations and hardly
learned patience, I have gained some of the
secrets of many of our best hardy flowering
plants and shrubs. Many friends have asked
me to tell them when to plant or transplant,
when to sow this or that seed, and how to
prepare the beds and borders; in fact, this
has occurred so often that it has long been
in my mind to write down what I know of
hardy gardening, that other women might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
helped to avoid the experiments and mistakes
I have made, which only served to cause
delay.</p>

<p>But just this &#8220;please write it down,&#8221; while
sounding so easy and presenting to the mind
such a fascinating picture of a well-printed,
well-illustrated and prettily bound book on
the garden, is quite a different matter to one
who has never written. When you diffidently
try to explain the chaos in your brain, family
and friends say, &#8220;Oh! never mind; just begin.&#8221;
That often-quoted &#8220;<i>premier pas</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>To-day is the first snow-storm of the
winter, and, while sitting by the fireside, my
thoughts are so upon my garden, wondering
if this or that will survive, and whether the
plants remember me, that it seems as though
to-day I could try that first dreaded step.</p>

<p>Living all my life, six months and sometimes
more of each year, in the country,&mdash;real
country on a large farm,&mdash;I have from childhood
been more than ordinarily interested in
gardening. Surrounded from babyhood with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
horses and dogs, my time as a little girl was
spent out of doors, and whenever I could escape
from a patient governess, whose eyes
early became sad because of the difficulties
of her task, I was either riding a black pony
of wicked temper, or was to be found in
a lovely garden with tall Arborvit&aelig; hedges
and Box-edged walks, in the company of an
old gardener, one of my very best friends, who
for twenty years ruled master and mistress,
as well as garden and graperies. Under this
old gardener, I learned, even as a child, to
bud Roses and fruit trees, and watched the
transplanting of seedlings and making of slips;
watched, too, the trimming of grape-vines,
fruit trees and shrubs; so that while still very
young I knew more than many an older person
of practical garden work. Then, as I
grew older, the interests of a gay girl, and,
later, the claims of early married life and the
care of two fat and fascinating babies, absorbed
my time and thoughts to the exclusion
of the garden. But as the babies grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
into a big boy and girl, the garden came to
the front again, and, for more than a dozen
years now, it has been my joy,&mdash;joy in summer
when watching the growth and bloom,
and joy in winter when planning for the
spring and summer&#8217;s work. There is pleasure
even in making lists, reading catalogues of
plants and seeds, and wondering whether this
year my flowers will be like the pictured
ones, and always, in imagination, seeing how
the sleeping plants will look when robed in
fullest beauty.</p>

<h2>HARDY GARDENING AND THE<br />
PREPARATION OF THE SOIL</h2>
<hr class="chap" />

<p class="head noindent center">CHAPTER II</p>

<p class="noindent center">HARDY GARDENING AND THE PREPARATION<br />
OF THE SOIL</p>

<p>It has not been all success. I have had to
learn the soil and the location best suited
to each plant; to know when each bloomed
and which lived best together. Mine is a
garden of bulbs, annuals, biennials and hardy
perennials; in addition to which there are
Cannas, Dahlias and Gladioli, whose roots
can be stored, through the winter, in a cellar.
All the rest of the garden goes gently to
sleep in the autumn, is well covered up
about Thanksgiving time, and slumbers
quietly through the winter; until, with the first
spring rains and sunny days, the plants seem
fairly to bound into life again, and the never-ceasing
miracle of nature is repeated before
our wondering eyes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>
<p>I have no glass on my place, not even a
cold-frame or hot-bed. Everything is raised
in the open ground, except the few bedding
plants mentioned whose roots are stored
through the winter. Therefore, mine can
truly be called a hardy garden, and is the
only one I know at all approaching it in
size and quantity of flowers raised, where
similar conditions exist.</p>

<p class="caption">A shady garden walk<br />
May thirty-first</p>
</div>

<p>I have observed that, with few exceptions,
the least success with hardy perennials is
found in the gardens of those of my friends
whose gardeners are supposed to be the best,
because paid the most. These men will grow
wonderful Roses, Orchids, Carnations, Grapes,
etc., under glass, and will often have fine
displays of Rhododendrons. But to most of
them the perennial or biennial plant, the old
friend blossoming in the same place year
after year, is an object unworthy of cultivation.
Their souls rejoice in the bedding-out
plant, which must be yearly renewed, and
which is beautiful for so short a time, dying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
with the early frost, I was astounded last
summer on visiting several fine places, where
the gardeners were considered masters of their
art, to see the poor planting of perennials and
annuals. I recall particularly two Italian
gardens, perfectly laid out by landscape gardeners,
but which amounted to nothing because
the planting was insufficient,&mdash;here a
Phlox, there a Lily, then a Rose, with perhaps
a Larkspur or a Marigold, all rigidly
set out in single plants far apart, with nothing
in masses, and no colour effects.</p>

<p>To attain success in growth, as well as in
effect, plants must be so closely set that
when they are developed no ground is to be
seen. If so placed, their foliage shades the
earth, and moisture is retained. In a border
planted in this way, individual plants are far
finer than those which, when grown, are six
inches or a foot apart.</p>

<p>First of all in gardening, comes the preparation
of the soil. Give the plants the food
they need and plenty of water, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
blessed sunlight will do the rest. It is wonderful
what can be done with a small space,
and how from April to November there can
always be a mass of bloom. I knew of one
woman&#8217;s garden, in a small country town,&mdash;house
and ground only covering a lot hardly
fifty by one hundred feet,&mdash;where, with the
help of a man to work for her one day in
the week and perhaps for a week each spring
and fall, she raises immense quantities of
flowers, both perennials and annuals. For six
months of the year she has always a dozen
vases full in the house, and plenty to give
away. More than half the time her little
garden supplies flowers for the church, while
others in the same village owning large places
and employing several men &#8220;have really no
flowers.&#8221;</p>

<p>I remember returning once from a two
weeks&#8217; trip, to find that my entire crop of
Asters had been destroyed by a beetle. It
was a horrid black creature about an inch long,
which appeared in swarms, devoured all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
plants and then disappeared, touching nothing
else. Such a thing had never before happened
in my garden. One of the men had
sprayed them with both slug-shot and kerosene
emulsion to no effect,&mdash;and so no Asters.
My friend with the little garden heard me
bemoaning my loss, and the next day sent
me, over the five intervening miles, a hamper&mdash;almost
a small clothes-basket&mdash;full of the
beautiful things. It quite took my breath
away. I wondered how she could do it, and
thought she must have given me every one
she had. Yet, upon driving over in hot haste
to pour out thanks and regrets, lo! there were
Asters all a-blow in such quantities in her
garden that it seemed as if none had been
gathered.</p>

<p>Except by the sea-coast, our dry summers,
with burning sun and, in many places,
frequent absence of dew, are terribly hard
on a garden; but with deep, rich soil, and
plenty of water and proper care, it will yield
an almost tropical growth. Therefore, whenever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
a bed or border is to be made, make it
right. Unless one is willing to take the
trouble properly to prepare the ground, there
is no use in expecting success in gardening.
I have but one rule: stake out the bed, and
then dig out the entire space two feet in
depth. Often stones will be found requiring
the strength and labor of several men, with
crowbars and levers, to remove them; often
there will be rocks that require blasting.
Stones and earth being all removed, put a
foot of well-rotted manure in the bottom;
then fill up with alternate layers, about four
inches each, of the top soil, taken out of the
first foot dug up, and of manure. Fill the
bed or border very full, as it will sink with
the disintegration of the manure. Finish off
the top with three inches of soil. Then it is
ready for planting. If the natural soil is stiff
or clayey, put it in a heap and mix with one-fourth
sand, to lighten it, before returning to
the bed. Thus prepared, it will retain moisture,
and not pack and become hard.</p>

<p class="noindent center">LAYING OUT A GARDEN AND BORDERS AROUND<br />
THE HOUSE</p>

<p>Perplexities assail a would-be gardener
on every side, from the day it is
decided to start a garden. The most attractive
books on the subject are English; and
yet, beyond the suggestions for planting, and
the designs given in the illustrations, not
much help is to be derived in this latitude
from following their directions. In England
the climate, which is without great extremes
of heat and cold, and the frequent rains, with
the soft moist atmosphere, not only enable
the English gardener to accomplish what
would be impossible for us, but permit him
to grow certain flowers out of doors that
here must be housed in the winter. Daffodils
and Narcissi bloom in England, near the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
coast, at the end of February and early in
March,&mdash;Lilies-of-the-Valley in March. Many
Roses live out of doors that would perish
here during our winters. Gardening operations
are begun there much earlier than in this
part, at least, of the United States, and many
of the methods for culture differ from those
employed here. In England there is excess
of moisture; therefore, care in securing good
drainage is essential, while here, except in
low places near streams, special provision for
drainage is rarely necessary. It is more important
to have a deep, rich preparation of
the soil, so that plants may not be dried out.
A serious part of the gardener&#8217;s work during
the average summer consists in judicious
watering of the garden.</p>

<p>One writer will say that this or that plant
should have sun, another that it does best
in the shade. One advocates a rich soil, another
a light sandy soil; so that after all, in
gardening, as in all else in life, experience is
the best teacher, either your own or that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
others who have already been successful under
similar conditions.</p>

<p>A garden is almost sure to be gradually
increased in size, and its capacity limited only
by the grounds of the owner and his pocket-book.
The possibilities and capabilities of a
couple of acres are great, and will give the
owner unlimited pleasure and occupation.</p>

<p>Individuality is one of the most marked of
American characteristics; hence, in making a
place, whether it is big or little, the tastes
and individuality of the owner will generally
direct his efforts, and no hard and fast rules
can be given.</p>

<p>In starting a garden, the first question, of
course, is where to plant. If you are a beginner
in the art, and the place is new and
large, go to a good landscape gardener and
let him give advice and make you a plan.
But don&#8217;t follow it; at least not at once, nor
all at one time. Live there for a while, until
you yourself begin to feel what you want,
and where you want it. See all the gardens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and places you can, and then, when you know
what you want, or think you do, start in.</p>

<p>The relation of house to grounds must
always be borne in mind, and simplicity in
grounds should correspond with that of the
house. A craze for Italian gardens is seizing
upon people generally, regardless of the architecture
of their houses. To my mind, an
Italian garden, with its balustrades, terraces,
fountains and statues, is as inappropriate for
surrounding a colonial or an ordinary country
house as would be a Louis XV drawing-room
in a farm-house.</p>

<p>What is beautiful in one place becomes
incongruous and ridiculous in another. Not
long ago, a woman making an afternoon visit
asked me to show her the gardens. Daintily
balancing herself upon slippers with the highest
possible heels, clad in a costume appropriate
only for a f&#234;te at Newport, she strolled
about. She thought it all &#8220;quite lovely&#8221; and
&#8220;really, very nice,&#8221; but, at least ten times,
while making the tour, wondered &#8220;Why in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>the world don&#8217;t you have an Italian garden?&#8221;
No explanation of the lack of taste that such
a garden would indicate in connection with
the house, had any effect. The simple, formal
gardens of a hundred years ago, with Box-edged
paths, borders and regular Box-edged
beds, are always beautiful, never become
tiresome, and have the additional merit of
being appropriate either to the fine country-place
or the simple cottage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ill_p_024" id="ill_p_024"></a>
<img src="images/ill_p_024.jpg" alt="" width="304" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Plan for a Small Plot</p>
</div>

<p>For a small plot of ground, like the one
before mentioned, the plan of which is on
page <a href="#ill_p_024">24</a>, the matter is simple, because of the
natural limitations. I love to see a house
bedded, as it were, in flowers. This is particularly
suitable for the usual American
country house, colonial in style, or low and
rambling. Make a bed perhaps four feet
wide along three sides of the house,&mdash;south,
east and west. Close against the house plant
the vines. Every one has an individual taste
in vines,&mdash;more so, perhaps, than in any other
ornamental growth. If the house be of stone,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>and the climate not too severe, nothing is
more beautiful than the English Ivy. It
flourishes as far north as Princeton, New
Jersey. I have never grown it, fearing it
would be winter-killed.</p>

<p><i>Ampelopsis Veitchii</i>, sometimes called Boston
Ivy, grows rapidly, clinging closely to the
wall and turning a dark red in the autumn,
and is most satisfactory.</p>

<p>The Virginia Creeper, and the Trumpet
Creeper, with its scarlet flowers, are both beautiful,
perfectly hardy, and of rapid growth.
All of these vines cling to stone and wood,
and, beyond a little help for the first two or
three feet, need not be fastened to the house.
Care must be taken to prevent the vines
growing too thickly to admit sun and air to
the house.</p>

<p>If the house be of wood, the question of
repainting must be considered. Both the
White and the Purple Wistaria, which can be
twined about heavy wire and fastened at the
eaves, Rambler Roses and Honeysuckles may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
be grown. They can be laid down, to permit
painting. But, if the house be of wood
and well covered with vines, put off the evil
day of painting until it can be deferred no
longer, and then have it done early in November.
Never, never permit it to be done
in the spring, or before November, unless
you would take the risk of killing the vines
or of losing at least a season&#8217;s growth. The
house surrounded by my gardens is colonial,
something over a hundred and fifty years old,
stern and very simple. Tall locusts, towering
above the roof, and vines that cover it from
ground to eaves, have taken away its otherwise
puritanical and somewhat uncompromising
aspect. These vines are mostly the
ordinary Virginia Creeper, which I had dug
from the woods and planted when the first
fat baby was two months old. Now their
main trunks are, in places, as large as my arm.
They have never been laid down. Whenever
the house has been repainted, I have been
constantly by, and admonished the men to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>gently lift the heavy branches while painting
under them, and not to paint the light tendrils.
When the master-painter has remonstrated,
that it was not a &#8220;good job&#8221; and took
three times as long as if the vines were laid
down, my reply has been, that &#8220;three times&#8221;
was nothing in comparison with the years it
had taken to grow them, and that stunting or
killing the vines could never be a &#8220;good job.&#8221;</p>

<p class="caption">Arch over rose-walk, covered with Golden Honeysuckle and
<i>Clematis paniculata</i><br />September fifteenth</p>
</div>

<p>Among the creepers are the Crimson Rambler
Rose and the Honeysuckle. In three
years the Roses have grown above the second-story
windows.</p>

<p><i>Clematis paniculata</i>, with its delicate foliage
and mass of starry bloom in early autumn,
is particularly good to plant by veranda posts
in connection with other vines. It grows
luxuriantly and is absolutely hardy. The
large white-flowered Henryi and purple-flowered
Jackmani Clematis, though of slow
growth, should always have a place, either
about a veranda, a summer-house or a trellis,
for the sake of their beautiful flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>While waiting for the hardy vines to make
their first year&#8217;s growth, the seeds of the
Japanese Morning-Glory, the Japanese Moonflower
and <i>Cob&oelig;a scandens</i> may be planted.
All of these will grow at least ten feet in
a summer, and cover the bare places. But
I would not advise sowing them among
the hardy vines, except the first summer.
In their luxuriance they may suffocate the
Roses and Clematis. The seeds of the Moonflower
must be soaked in hot water, and
left over night, before sowing. So much for
the vines about a house.</p>

<p>In front of the vines, and on the south
side in the same bed, plant masses of Hollyhocks,
from eight to twelve in a bunch,
and Rudbeckia in bunches of not more than
five, as they grow so large. Hollyhocks and
Rudbeckias plant two feet apart; they will
grow to a solid mass. In front of these,
again, put a clump of Phloxes, seven in a
bunch, and Larkspur, <i>Delphinium formosum</i>
being the best. On either side of the Delphinium
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
have clumps of about a dozen <i>Lilium
candidum</i>, which bloom at the same time.
Edge the border with Sweet Williams, three
kinds only,&mdash;white, pink and dark scarlet.</p>

<p>I should not advise making all the borders
around a house alike. The easterly one will
be most lovely if planted with tall ferns or
brakes, taken from near some stream in early
April, before they begin to grow. These will
become about four feet high if you get good
roots and keep them wet. Plant in among
them everywhere Auratum Lilies, and you
will have a border that will fill your heart
with joy. On the north side of the house it is
not possible to have much success with vines,
as they need the sun. They will grow, but
not with great luxuriance. Here plant two
rows of the common <i>Rhododendron maximum</i>,
which grows in our woods. I crave
pardon for calling it &#8220;common,&#8221; since none
that grows is more beautiful.</p>

<p>In front of these plant ferns of all kinds
from the woods, and edge the border with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Columbines. If these Rhododendrons do not
grow in your vicinity, they can be ordered
from a florist. In the hills, about five miles
from us, acres of them grow wild, and twice
a year I send my men with wagons to
dig them up. They stand transplanting perfectly
if care is taken to get all the roots,
which is not difficult, as they do not grow
deep. Keep them quite wet for a week after
planting, and never let them get very dry.
A good plan is to mulch them in early June
to the depth of six inches or more with
the clippings of the lawn grass, or with old
manure. When once well rooted, the Rhododendrons
will last a lifetime. They seem to
bear transplanting at any season. Some think
they do best if taken when in full bloom. I
have always done this in April or late October,
and, of a wagon-load transplanted last
October, all have lived. Many of these were
like trees, quite eight feet tall and too large
to be satisfactory about the house, so they
were set among the evergreens in a shrubbery.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ill_f_030" id="ill_f_030"></a>
<img src="images/ill_f_030.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="383" />

July fourth</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>In cold localities, where the thermometer
in winter falls below zero, Rhododendrons
should be mulched with stable litter or leaves
to the depth of one foot, after the ground
has frozen. They should also have some
protection from the winter sun, which can
be easily given them by setting evergreen
boughs of any kind into the ground here
and there among them. Rhododendrons are
as likely to be killed by alternate freezing
and thawing of the ground in winter as by
summer drought.</p>

<p>The lovely <i>Azalea mollis</i>, and many beautiful
varieties of imported Rhododendrons, are
usually described as &#8220;hardy,&#8221; but I cannot
recommend them to those who live where
the winters are severe. In such places their
growth is very slow, and many perish.</p>

<p>Maidenhair, the most beautiful of the hardy
ferns, is to be found in quantities in many
of our woods, particularly those covering hillsides.
Their favorite spot is along the edges
of mountain brooks. I know such a hillside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
where Maidenhair Ferns are superb. But
nothing would induce me to venture there
again, since I have been told it was infested
with rattlesnakes, and that the woodchoppers
kill a number of them every year. This fact,
too, gives me scruples about sending the men
to dig them up, although it is an awful
temptation.</p>

<p>All ferns should be transplanted late in
the autumn, or very early in the spring before
the fronds are started, as they are very
easily broken. This is particularly the case
with ferns from wet places. When planted
on the east or north side of a house, the
tall ones at the back, and Maidenhair and
other low varieties in front, they make a
beautiful bank of cool green. They must be
kept moist, however, to be successful, and in
dry weather require a daily soaking.</p>

<p>The Cardinal Flower, whose natural haunt
is along the banks of streams, and whose
spikes are of the most beautiful red, can
also be safely transplanted, and will bloom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>in deep, rich soil equally well in shade or
sun and will be very effective among the
Ferns. About the end of November, after
cutting the dead stalks, cover each plant
with a piece of sod, laid grass-side down.
Remove this the first of April, and the little
sprouts will soon appear above the ground.
Cardinal Flowers bloom for nearly a month&mdash;during
the last two weeks of August and
first two weeks of September.</p>

<h2>HOW TO PLANT A SMALL PLOT</h2>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="head noindent center">CHAPTER IV</p>

<p class="noindent center">HOW TO PLANT A SMALL PLOT</p>

<p>I am frequently surprised to hear people
say, &#8220;Oh, a flower garden is very nice,
but such a trouble!&#8221; I have heard this
expression several times from friends who
employ a number of men and have large
places with extensive lawns, shrubberies and
vegetable gardens, but without flowers, except,
perhaps, a few annuals growing among
the vegetables.</p>

<p>Yet no one is indifferent to the beauty of
garden, or unobservant of the improvement
which even a few flowers can make around
the humblest cottage. Think of the pretty
thatched cottages one sees everywhere in
England and France, covered to the eaves
with Roses and Clematis, and surrounded by
flowers growing wherever they can find root
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
in the tiny gardens. Yet all this is the result
of only a half hour&#8217;s daily care after the
long day&#8217;s work is done.</p>

<p>One should begin with a few plants&mdash;perhaps
a dozen only&mdash;and the &#8220;trouble&#8221; will
soon become a delight, unless one is devoid
of all love for flowers.</p>

<p class="caption">Vase of Peonies<br />
June sixth</p>
</div>

<p>Whenever I hear remarks on the &#8220;trouble&#8221;
of a flower garden, I think of those peasant
homes, and also of a little plot grown and
cared for by a certain tenant farmer&#8217;s wife I
know. She has six children, and must cook
and bake and clean for four men in addition;
yet, some time every day, she finds a few
minutes to tend her flowers. She has a border
along the fence four by fifty feet, filled
with perennials; a border across the front of
her house with Phlox and Funkias, and a
couple of beds with Asters, Poppies, Balsams,
Portulaca and Pinks. The perennials were
given her, a few at a time. She separated
the roots, saved the seeds to raise others, and
has been able in this way to increase her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>borders. The seeds of the few annuals she
buys do not cost more than a dollar a
year. Thus, for a trifling expenditure and a
short time every day, this woman makes her
humble surroundings beautiful, while her
soul finds an object upon which to expend
its love of beauty, and her thoughts have a
respite from the daily cares of life.</p>

<p>Many people have the mistaken idea that
a flower garden, however small, is an expensive
luxury, and are so convinced of this,
that they never venture any attempt at gardening,
and pass their lives knowing nothing
of its pleasures.</p>

<p>Let us suppose some one is starting a suburban
home in a simple way, and see how
flowers can be had for many months at small
cost. If one has a place in a town or village,
the plot of ground not over fifty by
two hundred feet, still the possibilities are
great, and the owner can easily gather flowers
for herself and her friends from April until
mid-November. A house or cottage on such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
a piece of ground generally stands back from
twenty to fifty feet, with a gravel or flagged
walk running to the street. If the owner be
a beginner in gardening and expects to do
most of the work herself, let her commence
with a few plants in a small space. As the
plants thrive and become beautiful, the care
of them will give an added pleasure to life,
and, little by little, the beds and borders can
be increased.</p>

<p>In beginning to plant a small plot, the
most natural place first is a border, say two
feet wide, on either side of the walk leading
from the house to the street. Have these
borders dug out and made properly. Then,
if the owner wishes to see them continually
abloom, bulbs must be planted, to give the
early spring flowers. Tulips can be had for
eighty cents a hundred, <i>Narcissus Poeticus</i> for
sixty-five cents a hundred, and Yellow Daffodils
for one dollar and twenty-five cents a
hundred. Hyacinths are more expensive, and
cost from four dollars a hundred up. If a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
hundred each of the Tulips, Narcissi, Hyacinths
and Daffodils were planted they would
make the borders lovely from early in April
until late in May. The Daffodils will bloom
first, then the Hyacinths, followed by the
Narcissi, and the Tulips last, if care is taken
to buy a late variety.</p>

<p>There should certainly be three or four
Peonies in the borders,&mdash;pink, white, and
dark red; good roots of these can be had for
about thirty-five cents each. Once planted,
they should not be disturbed for years; and,
although the first season they may not yield
more than two or three blossoms, in each
succeeding year the flowers will increase in
number. A friend told me, not long ago,
that she had counted sixty blossoms upon
each of several of her plants.</p>

<p>There should also be at least a dozen
Columbines (Aquilegias) to bloom the end
of May and the first of June. The roots of
these can be bought for a dollar and a half
a dozen, or they can be raised from seed; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the latter case, however, they would not bloom
until the second year, being perennials.</p>

<p>No border can be complete without Delphiniums
(Larkspur). Good-sized roots of
the <i>Delphinium formosum</i>, lovely dark blue,
are a dollar and twenty-five cents a dozen.
<i>Formosum C&oelig;listina</i>, the light blue variety,
is two dollars and a half a dozen. Then, of
course, there must be other perennials,&mdash;Phlox,
at least a dozen plants in the different
colours, which will cost a dollar and a
half.</p>

<p>A few Lilies will add greatly to the
beauty of the borders. Tiger Lilies, which
are only sixty cents a dozen; Auratums,
which can be had from eighty-five cents a
dozen up, according to the size of the
bulbs; <i>Speciosum rubrum</i> from eighty-five
cents a dozen up, and Candidums, or Madonna
Lilies, a dollar and a half a dozen.
German Iris, a dollar a dozen, and Japanese
Iris, at a dollar and a quarter a dozen,
should also have a place.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ill_f_042" id="ill_f_042"></a>
<img src="images/ill_f_042.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="384" />
<p class="caption"><i>Lilium speciosum rubrum</i><br />
September fifteenth</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Excellent Gladioli can be bought for a
dollar and fifty cents a hundred, and these
will be most satisfactory if planted in the
border about May fifteenth in groups of six
to ten.</p>

<p>A dozen Chrysanthemums of the hardiest
varieties to be obtained, and costing a dollar
and a half a dozen, will, with the other
plants mentioned, about fill two borders two
feet wide by thirty long. It would also be
well to sow the seeds of some Calendulas,
Nasturtiums and Asters wherever there may
be a vacant place. Or better, perhaps,
sow the seeds in boxes in mid-April, and
transplant to the border the early part of
June. The first cost will be the only expense
for these borders, except in the case
of the Auratum Lilies, which will die out
in about three years, and of the few flower
seeds. The only care needed is to keep the
borders free from weeds, to stir the soil
every week, and to water after sunset in
dry weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be seen, from the following list,
that such borders can easily be made and
planted at a cost of less than thirty dollars.
This can be reduced by omitting the Hyacinths.
Directions for planting are given
elsewhere.</p>

<p>After a year or two, the owner of the cottage
may want to increase the flower garden,
and the next place to plant is close about
the house. It is to be taken for granted
that the house and piazzas have the proper
gutters. This is necessary, of course, for the
preservation of the house, and without gutters
the drip from the eaves would be such
that nothing could grow directly against the
house.</p>

<p>The bed might be three feet wide and
run across the front of the house on either
side of the steps. The owner would probably
wish to plant vines over the porch or
piazza, in case it has not already been done.
The best for this purpose are mentioned
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Should the house front the south, east or
west, nearly everything can be grown; but
should it face the north, nothing but Ferns
and Rhododendrons would be successful on
the front. Dahlias of the Cactus variety, in
different colours, could be planted at the back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of the bed on one side of the steps. Get
good-sized roots, plant them two feet apart.
They will grow against the house like a tall
hedge. If planted the third week in April
quite deep, say eight inches, they will begin
to bloom about the sixth of July, and continue
to be covered with flowers until killed
by frost. In front of the Dahlias, plant white
Phlox. In front of the Phlox sow a row of
<i>Centaurea</i> or Cornflowers, the Emperor William
variety. These should be sown early in
April, will begin to bloom by June tenth,
and, if they are not allowed to go to seed,
will blossom all summer. Sow in front of the
Cornflowers, at the same time, a row of white
Candytuft, of the Empress variety. This also
will bloom continuously if the flowers are cut
as soon as they wither. On the other side
of the steps, at the back of the bed, plant
Rudbeckia (Golden Glow) two feet apart.
The roots should be bought and planted,
preferably in October, otherwise as soon as
the frost is out of the ground in the spring,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
as they start very early. In front of the
Rudbeckias plant Cannas&mdash;the Tarrytown,
of most vivid scarlet hue, I have found the
best and freest-flowering of all. The roots
should be planted about May fifteenth.</p>

<p>On the edge of the bed, sow by April
fifteenth a row of salmon-pink Zinnias, and
when they are well up, thin out to six
inches apart. They begin to blossom when
very small, and will stand considerable frost.
The expense of these beds will be trifling.
Rudbeckias of the Golden Glow variety,
one dollar a dozen; the Tarrytown Canna,
two dollars and a half a dozen; Cactus
Dahlias, two dollars a dozen; Phlox, one
dollar and a half a dozen. The small quantity
of flower seeds required will cost less
than a dollar. A man can easily make the
beds in three days. Therefore, the cost with
manure will be less than fifteen dollars.</p>

<p>After a hard frost has killed the tops,
the Dahlias, Cannas and Gladioli should be
taken up, the tops cut off, the roots well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
dried, and then stored in a cellar that does
not freeze. The Canna and Dahlia roots
will have grown so large that they can be
divided and it will be found that there are
enough to plant, the following spring, nearly
twice the space they occupied before.</p>

<p>It is impossible, if successful with the borders
already planned, for the owner not to
wish for more garden. She sees the neighbors&#8217;
gardens with newly opened eyes; flowers
and their treatment become an absorbing
topic of conversation, and the exchange of
plants a delightful transaction.</p>

</div>

<p>It will be seen that the next places to plant
are along the boundary lines of the property.
Even if one side only be laid out at a time,
a large number of plants will be required.
The owner will find great pleasure in raising
as many of these herself as possible. To
accomplish this, somewhere at the back of
the place, a seed-bed should be made, and
in April the seeds of perennials and annuals
sown. The border must be made by September
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>the twentieth and should be at least
four feet wide. Either a hedge can be
placed at the back of the border, or tall-growing
flowering shrubs, such as white
and purple Lilacs (not the Persian), Mock
Oranges (Syringa), Deutzia and Roses of
Sharon (Althea). These shrubs will grow
about equally high, yield an abundance of
flowers, the Altheas in August, the others
in May or June, and in four or five years
will form a complete screen from the neighboring
grounds.</p>

<p>In front of the shrubs perennials can
be planted, taller ones at the back, lower-growing
ones in front, and annuals along
the edge. Such a border, if from fifty to
a hundred feet in length, will be a garden
by itself. The plants will do best if closely
set, and every vacant space filled in June
with annuals. Weeds then have little chance
to grow, and a short time every day will keep
such a border in order. The border can be
of any width from four to twelve feet, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
when more than four feet, the front edge
should be made with irregular curves to
avoid a stiff appearance.</p>

<p>Shrubs should be set out not later than
October tenth, and, as they or the hedge
would be at the back of the bed, the planting
of them will not interfere with the perennials
that have already been transplanted
from the seed-bed. Hedges are so much
more beautiful than any fence that ever was
built that, in towns or villages where cattle
are not allowed to run at large, hedges should,
wherever possible, be used in place of fences.</p>

<p>To prepare the ground for a hedge, make
a trench eighteen inches deep, put a good
layer of well-rotted manure in the bottom
and fill up with earth. When the hedge is
planted give it a good top-dressing of manure,
and continue this top-dressing, with a little
bone-meal sown on the surface of the ground,
every spring.</p>

<img src="images/ill_f_051.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="388" />
<p class="caption">Planting on the edge of lawn<br />
August second</p>
</div>

<p>The best and hardiest evergreen hedge is
of Hemlock Spruce. Plants of this can be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>bought for fifteen dollars a hundred, and
should be set eighteen inches apart.</p>

<p>The Privet is a favorite hedge in this
country. It keeps green until December,
and leafs out early in the spring. It is
hardy and of rapid growth. Good plants
are six dollars a hundred, and should be
planted a foot apart. Catalogues say that if
planted in rich soil one foot apart, a hedge
five feet high can be grown in three seasons.
Common Privet is more hardy than California
Privet. <i>Hydrangea paniculata grandiflora</i>
makes a beautiful low-growing hedge; good
plants can be bought for six dollars a
hundred. <i>Berberis Thunbergii</i>, or Barberry,
makes a fine hedge, on account of its beautiful
foliage and scarlet fruit. It is, however,
slow-growing.</p>

<p>The owner of a small place should avoid
the temptation to scatter flower beds about
the lawn. Keep all the planting along the
edges of the property and around the house,
and leave the lawn unbroken by flower beds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
The years when gardening consisted only of
beds of Coleus, Geraniums, Verbenas and bedding
plants have passed away, like the black
walnut period of furniture. And even as the
mahogany of our grandfathers is now brought
forth from garrets and unused rooms, and
antiquity shops and farm-houses are searched
for the good old-time furniture, so we are
learning to take the old gardens for our
models, and the old-fashioned flowers to fill
our borders.</p>

<p>The nurseryman of to-day has greatly improved
the size and colour of the old varieties
of perennials, so that they are far more beautiful
than formerly, and offer a much greater
choice. By skilful hybridization a hundred
or more kinds of Phlox have been developed.
In the same way, numerous varieties
of Delphiniums, Iris, Peonies, Columbines,
Canterbury Bells and Foxgloves have been
produced. The old-fashioned annuals also
appear in many new forms. In addition to
the pink and white &#8220;Painted Lady,&#8221; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
pure white and the dark purple Sweet Peas
of our mothers&#8217; time, we may now cultivate
some eighty varieties of this delicate flower.
Thus the garden of hardy perennials, annuals
and bulbs will give us a continual sequence
of flowers in every form and colour from
April until November, if properly made and
tended.</p>

<h2>THE SEED-BED</h2>

<hr class="chap" />
<p class="head noindent center">CHAPTER V</p>

<p class="noindent center">THE SEED-BED</p>

<p>The possessor of a garden, large or small,
should have a seed-bed, where seeds of
perennials and some of the annuals can be
sown and grown until large enough to be
permanently placed. Not only will this bed
give great pleasure in enabling one to watch
the plants from the time the first tiny leaf
appears, but also when laden with blossoms
in fullest beauty. The knowledge that you
have raised them gives a thrill of pride in
the result which no bought plants, however
beautiful, can impart. It is not necessary
to prepare the seed-bed over a foot in depth,
but the soil must be very light and fine, as
well as rich. It is best, if possible, to have
a portion of the bed somewhat shaded from
the sun for a part of the day. If this combination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
cannot be had in one bed, there
should be a second for plants that want less
sun. Biennials must, of course, be sown
every year, as they bloom but once, then die.</p>

<p>Every year some perennials will disappear,
killed by severe winters, by pests of one kind
or another, or dying without apparent cause.
To keep up the supply, therefore, some of
each variety should be raised every year.</p>

<p>Foxgloves and Sweet Williams, if allowed
to go to seed, will sow themselves and increase
rapidly. The same with Hollyhocks,
but, except on the edges of shrubberies
and in wild borders, it is better to cut the
stalk just before the seed is ready to fall,
and save it to sow in the seed-bed.</p>

<p class="caption">Foxgloves&mdash;seedlings ready for final transplanting<br />
September twenty-ninth</p>
</div>

<p>In my garden, some seventy miles from
New York, and where the spring opens ten
days later, I sow my seeds,&mdash;the perennials
about the tenth of April and the annuals
from April twentieth to May first. Buy the
seeds, if the garden is large, by the ounce or
half-ounce; if small, in the seedsman&#8217;s packets.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>I always have the seeds of perennials
soaked for twenty-four hours before planting,
and find that by so doing they are very sure to
germinate. Care must be taken, when soaking
a number of different kinds at the same
time, to place the name of each variety of
seed under the glass or bowl containing the
same. When ready for planting, pour off the
water and mix the wet seeds carefully with
very dry earth, in a cigar-box, which is of
the right size and easy to handle. Then
sow, not too deeply, in rows about a foot
apart in the bed, covering very lightly, according
to size. One-half inch is enough for
the large seeds. The very fine varieties should
simply have the earth sprinkled on them.
If planted too deep they will never come up.
Seeds of annuals do not require soaking.</p>

<p>Pat the earth down firmly with the back
of the trowel, sprinkle with a fine sprinkler
late every afternoon, and it is not your fault
if you do not have hundreds and thousands of
young plants to make your own place beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and to give to your friends. It is a
keen delight, when a friend says that she has
not raised such and such plants this year, to
run and get your trowel and dig a bunch
of this and that from the rows of sturdy
little plants. It is a pleasure to know that
a bit of your garden has gone to help make
another&#8217;s beautiful.</p>

<p>One of the greatest pleasures of a garden
is in giving flowers and plants to your
friends. Every October, when arranging the
borders and separating plants, I send away
great boxes of them, some to fortunate
friends with lovely gardens, but without the
same varieties; some to humble cottage gardens,
and others to friends who have never
grown a flower, but would like to try. This
year, having made a large new garden, I was
able to give away to friends and neighbors
only about seven hundred plants, not seedlings
but large plants and roots. Generally
I can send away far more. Think what a
delight this is!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>A request for some plants came to me
last autumn from the baggage-master of a
railroad station some twenty miles from us,
who, by the boxes of shrubs and plants
that came to me, inferred that I might
have some to spare. I learned that all this
man&#8217;s spare time was spent in his little
garden plot, so great was his love of
flowers. I know, too, a village expressman
(another whom nature intended for a gardener),
whose little plot of ground is always
a mass of beauty. He has a surprising
variety of plants, and every one is a fine
specimen of its kind. His <i>Anemone Japonica
alba</i> are the finest I have ever seen,
each one sending up perhaps a dozen slender
stalks of the beautiful flowers. I have
had great difficulty with this plant and have
lost dozens of them. I always drive very
slowly by the expressman&#8217;s garden, burning
with envy and wondering how he does it.
In fact, it was only last year that I had
my first success with these obdurate plants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
They must grow under trees whose branches
are sufficiently high to admit the sun half
the day. As they bloom in September and
October, the tree protects them from the
frost, and in winter they should be well covered
with stable litter. They are among
the few plants to be set out in the spring,
for if not well established they are always
winter-killed.</p>

<p>It is well not to empty the perennial seed-bed
entirely in the autumn, but to leave a
few plants of each variety to transplant in
the spring, to take the place of those which
have not survived the winter. When the
bed is empty, in the spring, have a good
coating of manure spaded in and proceed
again with the sowing.</p>

<p>Biennials, and also most perennials, must
be raised every year to keep up the supply.</p>

<p class="noindent center">PLANTING</p>

<p>I cannot impress too strongly upon my
readers the importance of ordering their
plants and seeds of well-known firms. The
best are always the cheapest in the end.
Inquiry among friends will generally give
the best information as to reliable seedsmen
and growers. In ordering shrubs and plants
it is important to specify the precise date of
delivery, that you may know in advance the
day of arrival. The beds or borders should
be prepared in advance, so that everything
may be set out without delay. Care must
be taken that the roots are not exposed to
the air and allowed to become dry. It is a
good plan, when unpacking a box of plants,
to sort them, laying each variety in a pile
by itself, covering the roots with the moss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and excelsior in which they were packed,
and then, if at all dry, to sprinkle thoroughly.
Unpacking should, if possible, be done under
cover&mdash;in the cellar if there be no other
place.</p>

<p>Great care must also be taken in setting
out plants that ample room be given; as the
roots should be well spread out and never
doubled up. Do not be afraid of having the
hole too big; see that the earth is finely
pulverized and well packed about the roots;
that the plant is thoroughly soaked, and, if
the weather is dry, kept watered for a couple
of weeks. If the plants have arrived in
good condition and are carefully set out, but
few should die. I have never lost a deciduous
tree, and frequently, in setting out a
hundred shrubs at one time, all have lived.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ill_f_067" id="ill_f_067"></a>
<img src="images/ill_f_067.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="406" />
<p class="caption">Long grass walk, with Foxgloves blossoming in the border<br />

</div>

<p>Wherever there is a fence make a border,
wide or narrow according to your space; if
wide,&mdash;and it may be as much as twelve
feet wide,&mdash;always make the edge irregular,
never straight. Some prefer a hedge at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>back of the border. The best effect and
quickest screen is made by planting, against
the fence at the back of the border, White
Lilacs (not the Persian), Syringas, Deutzias
and the beautiful new Altheas. Plant these
shrubs three feet apart. In good soil they
will send up great canes, and in four years
time should be six feet high and shut you
in from all prying gaze.</p>

<p>In planting a border, always keep in mind
the fact that it should be blooming from
May to November. Put in the plants according
to height, the tallest, of course, at
the back and the lowest in front, filling the
front also with spring-flowering bulbs, Daffodils,
Tulips and Narcissi, which will blossom
and be over before the plants come on.
You will thus have the longest succession of
bloom. If the border is quite wide&mdash;from
four to six feet&mdash;and perhaps one hundred
and fifty feet long, it will hold a surprising
number of plants.</p>

<p>Certain plants, in a long border with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
background of shrubs, look best in rows, in
spite of all that has been written against it:
For instance, Hollyhocks, a long row of plants
three deep, broken every ten feet or so by
a clump of a dozen, and in front of these a
single row of Rudbeckias, broken with clumps
of six or so, and the rest of the border planted
in masses, more or less according to space, of
Phloxes, Larkspur, Lilies, Columbines, Sweet
Williams, with every now and then a good
clump of Chrysanthemums to blossom when
all other flowers are gone.</p>

<p>In filling a border along a rather short
path, the plants should always be set in
clumps of from six to twelve of a kind. If
the border is narrow and has no shrubs or
hedge back of it, the effect will be better if
the plants do not exceed three feet in height.
Omit from such a border Hollyhocks, Rudbeckias,
Sunflowers and Cosmos. Sweet Williams,
Columbines, Sweet Alyssum, Candytuft,
Nasturtiums and <i>Phlox Drummondii</i> can
all be grown as edging for borders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>I have a border, two and a half feet wide
and three hundred and fifty feet long, that
is a mass of bloom from the middle of May
until the last of September.</p>

<p>It may give the reader a suggestion to
know its contents. Everything is in rows,
the only border in my garden where the
planting is done in this way. Along the
edge is <i>Narcissus Poeticus</i>; back of <i>Narcissus
Poeticus</i> a row of Sweet Williams, pink,
white and very dark red; back of the Sweet
Williams, Foxgloves; back of the Foxgloves,
Peonies and <i>Hydrangea grandiflora</i> planted
alternately; and back of these, a row of
Hollyhocks. About two feet behind this
border, a row of Rudbeckia (Golden Glow)
grows like a tall hedge.</p>

<p>When <i>Narcissus Poeticus</i> has finished
blooming, the Peonies come on. Before the
last Peony has lost its petals, the Sweet
Williams (quite two feet high) are in blossom,
and the Foxgloves (from three to four
feet high) begin to bloom, and last for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
month. While these flowers are still lovely,
the tall Hollyhocks begin to flower, each
plant sending up from three to five stalks.
Then, by the time the Hollyhock stalks are
cut down, the Hydrangeas, which are trimmed
back very severely every autumn, are a mass
of white. Meanwhile the Rudbeckias, for
quite six weeks, form a yellow background.
The illustrations show this row of flowers
while the Narcissi, Peonies, Foxgloves, and
Hydrangeas are successively in blossom.</p>

<p>Early in June, I transplant into perennial
borders, wherever a spot can be found,
clumps of Asters, Cosmos and other late
annuals, which are beautiful in September
and October when most flowers have ceased
to bloom.</p>

<p>From September twentieth to October
fifteenth is a busy time in the garden. New
beds and borders should be made then. The
plants in all borders four years old should
be lifted, and the beds or borders spaded
deeply with plenty of manure, the plants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
reset, and the young perennials transplanted
from the seed-bed into their final places.
All perennial plants whose roots are sufficiently
large, should now be divided and
reset. This fall planting and transplanting
should be done at about the time mentioned,
for the shrubs and plants must become well
rooted before the ground freezes, or they
will rarely survive the winter. No matter
how rich a bed or border may be, I always
have the hole to receive the plant made
larger than is necessary, and put a spadeful
of manure in the bottom. In transplanting,
my man always has a wheelbarrow
of this at his side to work from.</p>

<p>If there are bare places in lawns or grass
paths, sow grass seed about the twentieth
of September, then roll, and the grass will
be well rooted before cold weather.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that everything
possible should be done in the fall. Perennials
start early in the spring, and it is a
pity, when they are once started, to disturb
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
them. When the frost has finally killed
everything, all the dead tops should be cut
off at the ground, the dead annuals pulled
up, the borders made clean and neat, and,
about the last of November, covered with a
good layer of stable litter, leaves or straw.
I have always found the plants start earlier
and do better for this slight protection.</p>

<p>Whenever I tell my inquiring friends of
the proper preparation of beds, and the spring
top-dressing, and winter covering with manure,
there is generally an exclamation of
alarm at the quantity used. But much is
required to make the garden grow. I call
upon the farm for manure when the stable
supply is insufficient, and both my farmer-husband
and his manager at times look
askance. But how can I live unless my garden
has what it needs! The farmer-husband
looks upon my gardening as a mild species
of insanity, and cannot understand why a
<i>little</i> garden with a few plants is not enough
for any woman. By dint of much showing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and explanation through many years, he has
acquired a floricultural knowledge which enables
him to tell a Rose, Lily, Sunflower and
Phlox, and of this knowledge he is proud.</p>

<p>All manure should be drawn out into the
garden when the ground is still frozen, in
March or earlier, and placed in convenient
piles, so that the ground may not be cut up,
when soft, by the wagon wheels; and also to
facilitate work when the first spring days
come, and there are a hundred things to be
done. If possible, have a spadeful of well-rotted
stable manure stirred into the ground
around each shrub and vine in early spring.
The result will amply repay you. Save all
wood-ashes carefully, under cover, for the
garden, and scatter them on the beds and on
the grass. Get well-ground fresh bone-meal,
and let all plants have only a handful in the
spring, and the reward in bloom is great.
To have good results from the hardy Chrysanthemums
the soil cannot be too rich, and
I generally &#8220;give them something to eat,&#8221;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
as a boy who helps in the garden calls
it, about the fifteenth of June and the
fifteenth of August.</p>

<p>Care must be taken, in using bone-meal,
not to put on too much, and to keep it
away from contact with the rootlets.</p>

<h2>ANNUALS</h2>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="head noindent center">CHAPTER VII</p>

<p class="noindent center">ANNUALS</p>

<p>There are so many annuals that I will
write only about the few which are
easiest to grow and are most desirable. For
me a flower must have merits for decorating
the house as well as for making the garden
beautiful.</p>

<p>The other day I found an English book
on flowers, and at once sat down to read
it, expecting enjoyment and profit from every
page; but at the end of a few minutes I
came upon the following paragraph:</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="small">&#8220;Particularly to most women one of the
chief uses or functions of a garden is to
provide flowers to be cut for the decoration
of rooms. But I hold that a flower
cut from its plant and placed in a vase
is as a scalp on the walls of a wigwam.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>

<p>And I read no further in that book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>I grow flowers to gather them, both for
the house and to give away. We keep
about sixty vases full in the house from
late May until October, and never allow
more than two colours in the same room.
I have a yellow room, where only yellow
and white flowers, or white and blue, are
permitted; a pink room, for white and pink
or pink and crimson flowers; and a hall,
whose dominant tone is a rich red, where
the flowers are red and white.</p>

<p>Some of the annuals, like Mignonette and
Poppies, must be sown where they are to
grow. Mignonette does best in cool, rather
moist soil.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ill_f_078" id="ill_f_078"></a>
<img src="images/ill_f_078.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="381" />
<p class="caption">Long grass walk, with Hydrangeas; Rudbeckias in the background<br />
August twenty-fifth</p>
</div>

<p>Poppies, and oh! have plenty of them
and all kinds. Get the Shirley Poppies, the
Giant Double, the fringed kind, and the
California with their sunny petals. Sow in
great numbers wherever they are wanted,
here and there in the borders wherever
there is space. If there is no other place,
sow them in rows in the vegetable garden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
They are splendid in the house, but, alas!
fall too quickly.</p>

<p>The Shirley Poppies are almost like fairy
flowers, they are so delicate and beautiful.
They are the first of the annual Poppies to
bloom. Then comes the variety which grows
wild in France and Germany,&mdash;scarlet, with
black blotches at the base of the petals. Last
to bloom are the tall, fringed double and single
Poppies,&mdash;white, pink and scarlet, growing on
strong stems three feet high. Poppies must
be sown thinly and the earth only sprinkled
over the seeds. Sow as early in the spring
as the ground can be worked, and thin out to
six inches apart when the plants are well up.</p>

<p>Nasturtiums, too, should be planted where
they are to grow, also Sweet Alyssum and
Candytuft. All of these make good edgings
for borders. If not allowed to go to seed
they will bloom all summer.</p>

<p>Sunflowers, the Dwarf Double, and the
tall Giant Sunflowers, are fine in backgrounds
and against fences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p class="center small"><span class="smcap">The Following Annuals Should be Sown in the Seed-bed<br />
About April Twentieth to May First</span></p>

<p><i>Antirrhinum</i>, or <i>Snapdragon</i>, growing
eighteen inches high. If sown in early May
they will bloom from August until late
autumn. The same is true of the German
Ten-weeks Stocks, which have a long period
of bloom. The white ones are most lovely.</p>

<p><i>Asters</i>, all varieties; sow a quantity.
They are not only beautiful, but they give
an abundance of blossoms in late September
and early October, when flowers are beginning
to be scarce. I prefer the Giant,
Comet, Ostrich Plume and the late-flowering
branching kind. Of these last, &#8220;Purity&#8221;
(snow-white) and &#8220;Daybreak&#8221; (shell-pink)
are the best, often bearing thirty flowers on
a plant and lasting, in water, five days. A
small quantity of wood-ashes stirred into
the soil of the Aster bed is a fine fertilizer
and destroys insects that attack the
roots. Transplant in June to wherever they
are to blossom.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ill_f_080" id="ill_f_080"></a>
<img src="images/ill_f_080.jpg" alt="" width="306" height="500" />
<p class="caption">A single plant of Asters<br />
September tenth</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>I have lately learned, that the only way
to destroy the black beetle which appears
upon the Asters and eats the flowers, is to
have them picked off morning and evening
and thrown into a pan containing kerosene
oil, which kills them.</p>

<p><i>Cosmos.</i> The early-summer flowering variety
of Cosmos will begin to bloom in July,
and, if not allowed to go to seed, will be a
mass of flowers until killed by frost. In
favorable soil Cosmos grows luxuriantly, and
resembles a small tree six or eight feet high.
This plant should be staked, or it is likely
to be blown down. It is very effective when
transplanted to the borders, blooming gayly
when there is not much else. The pink and
crimson varieties are beautiful, but do not
compare with the white.</p>

<p><i>Calendula</i>, growing about a foot high in
every shade of yellow from deep orange to
pale ivory, is one of the best and most constant
blooming of the yellow flowers.</p>

<p><i>Centaurea</i>, or <i>Cornflower</i>. These come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
in many colours, but I grow only the tall,
ragged, blue variety. If not permitted to
go to seed, they will bloom plentifully for
several months. On the dinner-table with
blue and white china, and in June combined
with Syringa, they make a beautiful and
unusual decoration.</p>

<p><i>Marigold</i>, both the double African and the
double French. These flowers always give
me a pricking of the conscience, for during
the summer, when there are plenty of
others, I give them the &#8220;go by,&#8221; but in
October turn to them with shame and thankfulness.</p>

<p><i>Phlox Drummondii</i> grows about six or
eight inches high, and comes in many colours.
It makes beautiful borders, particularly the
white, pink and dark red.</p>

<p><i>Plumed Celosia</i>, or <i>Cockscomb</i>. The new
varieties are very effective.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ill_f_083" id="ill_f_083"></a>
<img src="images/ill_f_083.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="380" />
<p class="caption">Poppies growing in rows<br />
July fourteenth</p>
</div>

<p><i>Zinnias.</i> Lately I have grown only two
varieties, a vivid scarlet and a salmon-pink.
They are not only lovely when growing, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
make a beautiful house decoration, as the
stems are long and stiff.</p>

<p><i>Sweet Peas</i>, which no garden can do without.
Several books say, plant in autumn,
very late. I have twice sown two pounds
at this time, carefully following the directions,
and not one single Pea came up the
following spring. Sweet Peas should be
sown in the spring the moment the frost
comes out of the ground, so that they may
become deeply rooted before dry weather.
Make a trench about a foot deep and a foot
wide. Have a good layer of manure in the
bottom of the trench, over which put a couple
of inches of earth, and over this earth put a
good layer of wood-ashes, again a sprinkling
of earth. Then sow the Peas, and cover them
with a couple of inches of earth. As they
grow, fill in the trench, and keep on hilling
up the plants until the roots are very deep.
It is well to mulch them with the clippings
of lawn grass. In this way the plants are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
kept from drying up, and will bloom until
October.</p>

<p>Sweet Peas flourish best on a trellis of
galvanized wire netting. It should be a
permanent trellis, made of cedar posts set
three feet deep, so as to be below the frost
line and four feet high. To this attach the
wire netting. A trench should be made on
either side of the netting, so that a double
row of Peas may be sown. The quantity
sown depends on the length of the trellis;
three pounds will sow a double row one hundred
and twenty-five feet long. I always sow
the different colours separately. It simplifies
the task of arranging them, if they can be
gathered separately. A bowl of white Sweet
Peas and Maidenhair Fern is indeed a &#8220;thing
of beauty.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Pansies</i>, every one loves them. They are
annuals, but do best if treated as biennials.
The most practical hint that I was able to
get from &#8220;Elizabeth&#8217;s German Garden&#8221; was
where she spoke of carpeting her Rose beds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
with Pansies. This instantly appealed to me,
as I greatly dislike to see the earth in the
beds and borders, and in Rose beds it always
is to be seen. So I bought an ounce each
of white and yellow Pansy seed, sowed it
about the tenth of July in the partly shaded
end of the seed-bed, and by October first
had splendid great plants. I did not allow
these to blossom, but picked off the buds,
and, after the Rose beds had been given a
plentiful top-dressing of manure carefully
stirred in with a large trowel, I transplanted
my Pansy plants. Of course, they had to
be covered over with the Roses the last of
November, and often during the winter I
wondered whether the dears would be smothered.
On the twenty-eighth of March the
beds were uncovered, and, imagine it! there
were Pansies in bloom. From April tenth
until late in August these beds were simply
a carpet of white and yellow. I never saw
anything like it. It was probably due to
the rich soil, perhaps also to the free watering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
necessary for the Roses. Then, in order
that no Pansies should go to seed, my own
maid, who is very fond of flowers, undertook
each morning to cut off all that were beginning
to wither. This required from one
to two hours, but certainly prolonged the
bloom, and I could never have spared a
man so long for just the Pansies. Sow
Pansy seed in the seed-bed about the tenth
of July, and transplant late in October.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>These are some of the more important
annuals which no garden should be without.
All of them are easy to raise, and blossom
abundantly. I do not speak of the many
others, but advise trying new flowers every
year.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ill_f_087" id="ill_f_087"></a>
<img src="images/ill_f_087.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="405" />
<p class="caption">A Bowl of Cosmos<br />
September twenty-ninth</p>
</div>

<p>The first week in June is the time to
transplant all annuals. Do it, if possible,
directly after a rain, always late in the
afternoon, and, of course, water well after
transplanting. I have a method of my own
for the transplanting of seedlings, and by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>following it the tiny plants never wither or
are set back, and in fact do not seem to
know that they have been moved. Take a
tin box, such as biscuits come in, half fill
it with water, then lift into it from the
seed-bed about one hundred seedlings at
a time. With a sharp-pointed stick make
holes in the bed where the little plants are
to go, and then put them in. Soak the
ground thoroughly after each patch is
finished. In this way the tiny rootlets
never become dry.</p>

<p>All the beds and borders can be kept free
from weeds and in good condition if gone
over with a trowel every five days, or once
a week, the earth stirred thoroughly, and
any weeds that may have grown taken out.
It is particularly necessary, for a few weeks
in the spring, to keep well ahead of the
weeds. I always think of my sins when I
weed. They grow apace in the same way

<h2>PERENNIALS</h2>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="head noindent center">CHAPTER VIII</p>

<p class="noindent center">PERENNIALS</p>

<p>Some of the perennials to be sown yearly
in the seed-bed from about April first
to tenth, are the following:</p>

<p><i>Columbines</i> of all varieties, yellow, white,
shading from pink to red and from pale
blue to darkest purple.</p>

<p>Of Columbines every garden should have
plenty. Blooming about May twentieth for
three weeks, they are a perfect delight.
They are very hardy, germinate readily in
the seed-bed, are easy to transplant and need
but little care. I have never been able to
get them much over three feet in height,
but then I have often a dozen stalks of
bloom on a single plant, which is very satisfactory.
The first dozen plants were sent to
me by a friend from his garden on Long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Island; now I have hundreds of them,&mdash;single
and double, white, yellow, all shades of
red and pink, pale blue, and a blue one
with a white center almost like an Orchid;
many shades of purple, also purple and white.</p>

<p><i>Hollyhocks</i>, single and double, of all colours.
In order to get the desired colour effect with
these, keep each variety separate.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ill_f_094" id="ill_f_094"></a>
<img src="images/ill_f_094.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="384" />
<p class="caption">Hollyhocks in blossom<br />
July twelfth</p>
</div>

<p>No one can have too many Hollyhocks.
Plant them at the back of the borders among
the shrubbery, along fences, and in great
clumps in any odd corner, or around buildings;
they are never amiss, and always beautiful.
I find that a Hollyhock cannot be
counted upon to bloom more than three
years. First-year stalks are about four feet
high; afterwards, if in good soil, they will
be from six to eight feet. There were hundreds
of this size in my garden last summer,
each plant with from three to five towering
stalks of bloom. As soon as they have gone
to seed, I save what seed I want and the
stalks are then cut down and burned. By
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>sowing the seeds as soon as thoroughly ripe
and dry, plants can be raised which will be
large enough to transplant in October, and
will bloom the next year. These young plants
should be given a slight covering the first
winter, that they may not be winter-killed.</p>

<p>When in a border, the Hollyhock, which
will flourish in any soil, grows to such an
extent that Lilies or Phloxes, or anything else
near by, are likely to be crowded out, unless
care is taken to cut off the lower leaves, which
become enormous. I have this done usually
three times before they bloom, beginning
early in May, and great wheelbarrow-loads of
leaves are taken away at each cutting.</p>

<p><i>Sweet Williams</i>, red, white and pink. These
will grow from eighteen inches to two feet.
The stems are straight and stiff, and the
trusses of bloom about five inches across,
with individual flowers as large as a nickel;
they keep well in water and make a beautiful
edging for a border, or give great effect
when planted in masses. They bloom for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
three weeks or more, and make fine decorations
for church or house.</p>

<p><i>Platycodon Mariesi</i>, beautiful blue; they
resemble Canterbury Bells, and, as they
blossom after the Canterbury Bells, are valuable
in continuing the period of blue flowers,
with the advantage of being perennials.</p>

<p><i>Delphiniums</i>, perennial Larkspurs, all varieties.
These seeds I have found more difficult
to make germinate than any others, so
I do not rely upon what I raise, but purchase
many plants. My best results have come
from saving the seeds from the first crop
of blossoms, drying thoroughly, and then sowing
at once. I have found these seeds more
sure to germinate than those bought in early
spring. Perhaps nature intends them to be
sown in this way, instead of nine months later.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ill_f_097" id="ill_f_097"></a>
<img src="images/ill_f_097.jpg" alt="" width="337" height="500" />
<p class="caption">A single plant of Delphinium (Perennial Larkspur)<br />
June twenty-first</p>
</div>

<p>One can never say enough in praise of
Delphiniums. Three-year-old plants will
send up eight to ten beautiful great spikes
of the richest blue, four feet high. The
moment a blossom withers, cut the stalk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>down to the ground; another will immediately
spring up. I had four crops of blossoms
from some of my Delphiniums last
summer, so that, from the end of June
until the middle of October, there were
always some of them in blossom. Some
varieties of tall English Delphiniums are
very beautiful. Among them is one, C&oelig;lestinum,
of the loveliest shade of light blue,
with very large, double individual flowers.
As I have said before, the Delphinium blossoms
at the same time as <i>Lilium candidum</i>,
and should be planted near by. Great
bunches of these two flowers, in tall vases,
are lovely as well as unusual.</p>

<p>There is a horrid small white worm which
attacks the roots of the Delphinium, and
gives no sign until you see the plant dying.
I have found that keeping the soil around
the plant well covered with coal ashes is
a preventive. Delphiniums are hardy and
long-lived (unless the worm gets them),
and, once planted, they live a dozen years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Coreopsis</i> (Grandiflora). Every one knows
the Coreopsis, which, by continual cutting,
will give abundant bloom for three months.
The variety with velvety maroon centers is
particularly fine.</p>

<p><i>Hibiscus</i> is very easy to raise, and should
be planted among and along the edge of
shrubbery. The plants are quite hardy, grow
four feet high, and masses of them in pink
or white are fine. They bloom in August
and September.</p>

<p><i>Rockets</i>, white and purple. These increase
tremendously from self-sowing, so be careful
or they will suffocate all that grows near
them. I have many plants, all of which
have come from a single one that a colored
woman gave me a few years ago. She is a
nice comfortable old &#8220;mammy,&#8221; black as the
ace of spades, with a great love for flowers
and a nice patch of them. We have exchanged
plants several times. Some of the
nicest things I have in my garden came to
me in this way, and it is great fun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Whenever, in driving about, I see a particularly
fine plant in a dooryard, I make
friends with its owner, and later suggest that
if she (it is usually &#8220;she&#8221;) will give me a
small root of this or that, I will bring her
some plants or bulbs from my garden, of a
kind which she has not. So we are both
equally benefited. In this way I was once
given a plant of <i>Valerian</i>, which has a tall,
beautiful white flower with a most delicious
odour like vanilla. It blooms for three weeks
in late May and early June. From this one
plant there are now in the garden a number
of large clumps several feet in diameter, and
I have given away certainly fifty roots.
Valerian is a small white flower in good-sized
clusters on long stems, seen now-a-days only
in old-fashioned gardens. I am told it cannot
be bought of horticulturists.</p>

<p>One must have <i>Chrysanthemums</i>, but where
the thermometer falls below zero there are
not many to be bought, other than the pompon
varieties, that will blossom in the garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
before being killed by frost, or that will
survive the winter. Year after year I have
bought dozens of the so-called &#8220;September-flowering
Chrysanthemums,&#8221; and have only
succeeded in making them blossom by the
middle of October, by planting them on the
south side of a building, in richest soil, giving
abundance of water, and covering on all
cold nights. But I have beautiful plants of
perfectly hardy, good-sized blossoms of yellow,
white, pink and red, the roots of which
have come from the gardens of my farmer
friends. I have never been able to buy this
old-fashioned hardy kind. In the spring, as
soon as the plants begin to sprout, divide
them, setting out three or four sprouts together.
In this way the stock will increase
wonderfully.</p>

<p>Chrysanthemums require very rich soil,
must have sun, and do best against a building
or a wall. About the first of July and
the first of September have a couple of
trowelfuls of manure carefully dug in about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the roots of each plant. Buds should not
be allowed to form until September, and the
new shoots should be pinched back until
then, to make the plants strong and bushy.
I do not envy any one who has only the
great, solemn, stiff flowers of the prize-show
variety. An armful of the hardy garden
ones, with their delicious odour, is worth a
green-house full of the unnatural things
which are the professional gardener&#8217;s pride.
When you can keep twenty or more vases
filled from your own garden with these last
blossoms of the year, in all their lovely
colours, and not miss one of them from the
plants, you will agree with me that they are
the only kind to raise.</p>

<p>Perennials, sown in rows in the seed-bed
in April, will be nice little plants by July,
when they should be lifted and transplanted
some six inches apart. The portion of the
seed-bed where the annuals were raised can
be used now for the purpose. This is particularly
necessary for Larkspur, Columbines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Monkshood, Platycodon, Coreopsis, Hibiscus
and Pinks. If, when transplanting, each plant
is set with a trowelful of manure, the result
will be plants twice as large by the first of
October, when they can be again transplanted
to their permanent places.</p>

<p><i>Oriental Poppies</i> and <i>Pinks</i> should also
be sown in the perennial seed-bed.</p>

<p>Oriental Poppies, with great blossoms as
large as a tea plate borne on strong stems,
make a grand show about the end of May
and beginning of June.</p>

<p>Pinks, too, should be in every garden, if
only for their delicious, spicy odor. The
Chinensis, or China Pinks, are the best.</p>

<p>Sweet Williams and Oriental Poppies need
not be moved from the time they are sown
until finally transplanted in the autumn.</p>

<p class="caption">Yuccas in blossom<br />
July twelfth</p>
</div>

<p><i>Yucca filamentosa</i>, the hardy native of
Mexico, sends up, about the tenth of July,
great stalks six to eight feet high, bearing
masses of white flowers. The individual
blossoms are of creamy waxy texture and as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>beautiful as an orchid. A single stalk of
Yucca, in a tall vase, will last nearly a
week, and is as unusual as it is beautiful
for house decoration. Yuccas are perfectly
hardy, need no protection in winter, no fertilizer,
no water in dry weather. In my
garden, at least, they have not been attacked
by insects and have grown placidly on,
needing absolutely no care but to have the
stalks cut down when they have finished
blossoming. They are most effective when
grown in clumps, but look very well along
a fence with Hollyhocks at the back. The
plants are so inexpensive that I have bought
mine, but see no reason why they cannot
be raised from seed. Small plants form near
the parent stem, and these can be separated
and transplanted. A late spring frost will
sometimes nip the flower stalk that has
just started, and there will be no bloom that
year. To avoid such a disaster, whenever,
in late spring, a frosty night is suspected,
cover the plants with a piece of burlap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Tritomas</i> (Red-hot Poker Plant) bloom in
September and October, and should always
be planted in masses, and in full sun. They
must be well covered with leaves or stable
litter late in November, or they will be
winter-killed. They increase rapidly.</p>

<p><i>Gaillardias</i> bloom all summer, and keep
fresh in water for days. The plants are
covered with long-stemmed, yellow flowers
with dark crimson centers, and should also
be protected in winter.</p>

<p><i>Veronica longifolia</i>, a most beautiful dark
blue flower, which grows in long spikes.
Veronica remains in bloom during the month
of August, and is one of the most showy
flowers in the garden at that time.</p>

<p><i>Iris</i>, Japanese and German, do well when
naturalized in the grass. These plants increase
so, that every four years they can be
separated. Beginning with the German Iris,
flowering the end of May, they can be had
in bloom until the Japanese Iris finishes
blossoming the middle of July. No Orchids<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
are more beautiful than the Japanese Iris.
A couple of weeks before and during the
period of bloom they must be kept very
moist.</p>

<p>Both the German and the Japanese Iris
are perfectly hardy and increase rapidly. The
English Iris, of which the white variety,
known as Mont Blanc, is the most beautiful,
and the Spanish Iris, in all its varieties, are
not hardy. But with careful winter covering,
about equal to that given to the everblooming
Roses, they will generally survive,
and are well worth the trouble. The roots
of all varieties of Iris are very long, and
care must be taken to give them plenty of
room and to plant deep.</p>

<p><i>Peonies.</i> For beauty and usefulness Peonies
rank with Phloxes. Large plants will
frequently bear twenty great blossoms. By
raising both early and late varieties, their
period of bloom can be continued for a
month. The old, dark crimson variety is the
first to bloom; the old-fashioned double pink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and double white are beautiful enough to
satisfy any one, but the new varieties give
immense choice as to colour and form.</p>

<p>The Japanese Tree Peonies do not die to
the ground every year, like the herbaceous
kinds, but form woody branches and grow
like a small shrub. The blossoms of these
Tree Peonies are truly wonderful; the only
care needed is a little fertilizer in the autumn
and a slight winter covering. They are best
grown in front of the shrubbery. They
blossom before the herbaceous varieties. The
herbaceous Peonies can be grown in large
beds by themselves, in borders with other
plants, or as single specimens in the grass
or among the shrubs.</p>

<p>Peonies start so early in the spring that
they should be manured in the fall, or there
is danger of breaking the tender shoots.</p>

<p class="caption">Bed of Peonies on edge of lawn<br />

</div>

<p><i>Phlox.</i> There is no flower in the garden
more beautiful, more easily cultivated, or giving
so much bloom as the Phlox. I could
certainly never have a garden without it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>In mine there must be a couple of thousand.
I have a great mass, of probably two hundred
herbaceous Phloxes, growing together
in one corner of my garden, the very tall
varieties over four feet high. About the
fifteenth of July, every year, this corner is
a superb sight. Most of these plants are
over fifteen years old. They have been kept
fine by heaviest top-dressing every year, and
by lifting all the plants every three years
and digging in quantities of manure, and
also by separating each plant into three, by
cutting the roots with a spade, or pulling
apart with the fingers.</p>

<p>The newer varieties of Phlox come in the
most beautiful colours,&mdash;dark crimson, fiery
scarlet, many shades of pink, pink striped
with white, and pink with a white eye; all
shades of lilac, lilac with white and purple,
the beautiful pure white, and the white with
the scarlet eye. Of all the varieties, my
favorites are the snowy white, and the
salmon-pink with the dark red eye. Buy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
fifty large field-grown plants; at the end
of three years separate them, and you have
a hundred and fifty. They present a picture
of progression much surer than the tale of
the eggs that were to do so much.</p>

<p>Many of the individual blossoms of my
Phloxes are larger than a fifty-cent piece;
a number of them larger by measurement
than a silver dollar, and the heads also are
very large. Always erect, neat and smiling,
never needing to be staked (such a task in a
large garden), when once grown they must
always be dear to a gardener&#8217;s heart. By
breaking off the heads of Phlox immediately
after blooming, a second crop of flowers
will appear in about three weeks. The heads
will not be so large as the first, but they
will amply repay the slight trouble.</p>

<p>Every owner of a garden has certain favorites;
it really cannot be helped, although
the knowledge that it is so makes it seem
almost as unfair as for a mother to have
a favorite child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>A real lover of flowers finds it difficult
to cast away a plant that has bloomed its
best, even though the blossom is unsatisfactory.
In my garden there are, at present,
some plants that I am longing to dig up
and burn. There are two climbing Roses
that came by mistake in a large order and
were set out. They have thriven as no
others, cover a very large space on a trellis,
and in June bear thousands of a most hideous,
small, purplish crimson Rose. The
other plant is <i>Scabiosia Caucasica</i>. Beware
of the same. The description of it in a
catalogue caused me to feel that without
it the garden was nothing. A dozen were
ordered and set out in a border, in two
clumps. They grew and waxed strong, and
fairly clambered over everything within
several feet of them, seeming to be like
gigantic thistles. Finally in August, on
stems two feet long, the eagerly looked-for
blossoms appeared. These were described in
the catalogue as &#8220;a large head of pale blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
flowers.&#8221; But, to my despair, it developed a
round green ball about three inches in circumference,
with white thistle-like petals.
And yet the plants had surpassed themselves.
It seems a poor reward to turn
them out to die.</p>

<p><i>Lychnis</i> (London Pride). I cannot now
recall any perennial except the Cardinal
Flower, which has blossoms of so brilliant a
scarlet as Lychnis, or London Pride, growing
tall and erect, with its bright colour. It is
most effective when grown in large clumps.</p>

<p><i>Monkshood</i> (<i>Aconitum Napellus</i>) grows
four feet high, and has a beautiful blossom
of rich blue growing in quite large clusters.
The name must come from the resemblance
each individual blossom bears to the capuchin
of a monk. These plants should be grown
under tall trees, for they cannot stand too
strong sun, and will blossom very late
in the autumn if protected by the trees
from frost. I gathered them last year in
November.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Phloxes, Rudbeckias, Monkshood, Valerian,
Lychnis, Tritomas, Iris, Peonies and Veronica
are best raised, not from seed, but by
buying the plants, and then after a time,
as I have said before, dividing them. For
instance, take a fine large plant of Phlox
of some choice variety, divide all the roots
and set out each one separately. From one
plant you may, in two years&#8217; time, get twenty
splendid ones, and the same with the other
varieties I have mentioned.</p>

<p><i>Rudbeckias</i>, of the Golden Glow variety,
grow from six to eight feet high, and must
be staked, or when heavy with blossoms
they will blow down or be beaten down by
the rain. Each plant will bear quantities of
long-stemmed double yellow blossoms, which
resemble a double Dahlia. These will keep
nearly a week in water. When the plant
has finished blossoming, cut down the tops,
and in October there will be a second crop
of blossoms just above the ground.</p>

<p>The Golden Glow should be divided every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
other year, and in this way it is even more
remunerative than the Phlox. I started
with fifty plants, and think it will soon be
possible to have a farm of them.</p>

<h2>BIENNIALS AND A FEW BEDDING-OUT PLANTS</h2>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="head noindent center">CHAPTER IX</p>

<p class="noindent center">BIENNIALS AND A FEW BEDDING-OUT PLANTS</p>

<p>There are but few hardy biennials.
The important ones, which no garden
should be without, are: <i>Digitalis</i> (Foxgloves)
and <i>Campanula medium</i>, (Canterbury Bells.)</p>

<p>Foxgloves and Canterbury Bells bloom in
June and July for more than a month, and
give a touch of glory to any garden.</p>

<p>Catalogues and many gardening books
say that the seeds should be sown in early
autumn, and the plants will bloom the following
year. It is true that they will bloom
when sown in the autumn, but unless kept
over the winter in a cold-frame the plants
will send up stalks, only about a foot in
height.</p>

<p>Sow the seeds of Foxgloves and Canterbury
Bells in the shady part of the seed-bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
in early April. Keep the young plants
moist. About the fifteenth of July, if there
are a large number of plants and there be
no other place, they should be transplanted
to the vegetable garden, where they can follow
early crops of peas or lettuce. Have
the ground spaded finely, and make shallow
trenches, perhaps six inches deep, in which
put a good layer of manure and cover this
with earth, then set the plants about six
inches apart. Keep them well watered when
the weather is dry, and the earth thoroughly
stirred. By the twentieth of September or
the first of October they should be transplanted
to the places where they are to
bloom the following year. The plants
should then be a foot across, and next
June will send up several stalks about three
feet high. The Canterbury Bells should be
six inches across in the fall, and the next
year about two feet high.</p>

<p class="caption">A single plant of Foxgloves; White Sweet William in front<br />

</div>

<p><i>Foxgloves</i> seed themselves with great
abundance, unless the stalk is cut before the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>seed ripens. In the spring I have the little
plants, seeded in this way from the year before,
taken from the borders and transplanted
in rows, and find they are larger and stronger
than any others.</p>

<p>Foxgloves, white, spotted and pale lilac,
are the pride of the garden. Plant them
back of the Sweet Williams, in clumps of
six or eight, or else with Peonies. They
blossom at the same time, and the pinks or
reds of Sweet Williams or Peonies, with
here and there a mass of white, and the tall,
graceful spikes of the Foxgloves rising above
them, produce so beautiful an effect that
you will simply have to go and look at
them many times a day.</p>

<p><i>Canterbury Bells.</i> Let any one who has
been at Oxford in June and July recall the
Canterbury Bells in those loveliest of all
gardens, New College and St. Johns, and she
will not rest until they have a place in her
garden. I did not know these flowers before
going to Oxford, and after seeing them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
could not wait to raise them from seed, but
bought three dozen plants to look at the
first year. The roots that came to me were
miserable little things, and, in spite of every
care, half of them died. Those which lived
and bloomed were very lovely. They begin
to blossom with us about the sixth of June,
and last four or five weeks. In colour they
are white, pink, purple and blue.</p>

<p>Canterbury Bells and Foxgloves are biennials.
They are sown one year and grow
for a year, then bloom and die. This seems
a great deal of trouble for one season&#8217;s
flowers, but their beauty repays the gardener
a hundred fold. They require a slight winter
protection of leaves or stable litter, but
care must be taken that the tops of the
plants are not covered.</p>

<p class="noindent center">THE BEDDING-OUT PLANTS</p>

<p>And now a little about the only three
bedding-out plants that I grow&mdash;Dahlias,
Cannas and Gladioli. I should have said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
four, for there is always a large bed of about
four dozen Scarlet Salvia (the Bonfire variety
is the best), whose brilliant colour and sturdy
growth cannot be spared. They begin to
blossom in July. By driving a tall stake in
the center, and other stakes around the
edge of the bed of Salvia, it can be covered
with burlaps or carriage covers when the
nights are frosty and preserved in all its
beauty until November.</p>

<p><i>Dahlias</i> can be grown in rows in the vegetable
garden, if there be no other place
for them. They are decorative and desirable
for cutting. Plant two or three tubers in a
hill about the third week in April. They
should be planted eight inches deep and
three feet apart, and kept well staked. The
soil should not be too rich, or they will all
grow to stalk and leaf, and blossom but little.
All the varieties are lovely, the Cactus
kind more so, perhaps, than the others. In
the autumn, when the tops have been killed
by the frost, the tubers must be taken up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
dried off carefully, and stored in a cellar
that does not freeze.</p>

<p><i>Gladioli</i> can be planted from April fifteenth
to June fifteenth, in beds by themselves
or in clumps in the borders, so that
the blossoms may be had in succession.
Gladioli come in many colours.</p>

<p><i>Cannas</i>, the beautiful French varieties.
These, of course, are most effectively grown
in masses, and require full sun. The roots,
like those of the Dahlias, increase so that
there is almost double the quantity to plant
the next spring. It is well to have the
Cannas started in boxes in sunny windows,
in tool-room or carriage-house, by mid-April.
They can be kept through the winter with
the Dahlias and Gladioli.</p>

<h2>ROSES</h2>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="head noindent center">CHAPTER X</p>

<p class="noindent center">ROSES</p>

<p>The Rose asserts her right to the title
of the &#8220;queen of flowers&#8221; through her
very exclusiveness. She insists upon being
grown apart from other plants; otherwise she
sulks and is coy, refusing to yield more than
an occasional bloom. I speak from experience,
having tried several times to grow
Roses in the front of wide borders, where
soil and sun and everything except the
proximity of other plants was propitious.
But they scarcely bloomed at all. Now, the
same bushes, planted in rows so that a cultivator
may be run between them, flourish
satisfactorily. Grow Roses, then, in beds by
themselves or in rows.</p>

<p>If one has but half a dozen Roses, let
them be grown apart from other plants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Pansies, however, can be grown in the
Rose beds, as I have elsewhere described;
Gladioli can also be planted among them
without detriment to either. The reason
for this is that the roots of these two flowers
are not deep and do not interfere with
the nourishment of the Roses.</p>

<p>Roses on their own roots should live for
years, if given proper treatment. Witness
the Rose bushes in gardens, where with but
little care they have flourished more than a
generation.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ill_f_126" id="ill_f_126"></a>
<img src="images/ill_f_126.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="394" />
<p class="caption">Summer-house, covered with Clematis and Crimson Rambler Roses<br />

</div>

<p>Budded stock must be planted very deep.
The joint should be at least three inches
under ground. Roses grown on their own
roots are more expensive than the budded
stock, but a far better investment. The
budded stock is apt to send up from the
parent root suckers or shoots of Sweetbrier,
Buckthorn, Flowering Almond, or whatever
it may be. These shoots must be carefully
cut off. A friend told me that, when new
to Rose growing, his bed of budded Roses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>sent up so many strange shoots that, not
knowing what to do, he dug them all up
but one. This he kept as a curiosity, and
now it is a bush of Flowering Almond six
feet in circumference.</p>

<p>Everblooming Roses should be set out in
the spring, about the middle of April.</p>

<p>Hybrid Perpetual and Hardy Roses are
best set out in autumn, about October tenth.
When planting, always cut the plants back
to about a foot in height.</p>

<p>All Roses should be lifted every three
years, late in October, and plenty of manure,
with fresh earth and leaf-mould, mixed with
sand if the soil is heavy, dug in.</p>

<p>After five or six years I dig up my Roses
about October tenth, cut the tops down to
about twelve inches, cut out some of the old
wood, cut off the roots considerably, trench
the ground anew, and replant. The following
year the Roses may not bloom very profusely,
but afterwards for four or five years
the yield will be great. My physician in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
country is a fine gardener, and particularly
successful with Roses. We have many delightful
talks about gardening. When I told
him of my surgical operations upon the
Roses he was horrified at such barbarity,
and seemed to listen with more or less
incredulity. So I asked him if, as a surgeon
as well as physician, he approved, on occasion,
of lopping off a patient&#8217;s limbs to
prolong his life, why he should not also
sanction the same operation in the vegetable
kingdom. He was silent.</p>

<p>I shall not say much about Roses, because
there is so much to say. They need a
book by themselves, and many have already
been written. In my garden there are not
more than five hundred Roses, including the
climbing varieties. They have done very well,
and have not been given more care than
other plants.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ill_f_129" id="ill_f_129"></a>
<img src="images/ill_f_129.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="386" />
<p class="caption">Rose bed carpeted with Pansies<br />
June twenty-first</p>
</div>

<p>For years I did not grow Roses, fearing
they would not be a success. I had read
about the beetles and spiders and other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>creatures that attack them, and dreaded the
spraying and insect-picking that all the
books said must be done. But, of course,
I finally yielded to the temptation of having
the very flower of all flowers, in my
garden, and have found the trouble slight
and the reward great. I have them in beds
in a little formal garden, and in rows in a
picking garden.</p>

<p>The beds and the trenches for the rows
are both made in the usual way, and every
fall, in late October, before the Pansies are
set out as already described, manure is dug
in, and in the early spring, about the tenth
of April, a handful of finely ground fresh
bone-meal is stirred in around each plant
with a trowel. They are sprayed with slug-shot
three times between April tenth and
May fifteenth, when they get a thorough
spraying with kerosene emulsion, and, as a
result, my Roses are not troubled with the
usual pests.</p>

<p>In November the hardy perpetuals are all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
cut back to about two feet in height, and
the old wood is thinned out. The everblooming
Roses are cut back to a foot in
height. And Roses! well, really, no one
could ask better from a garden. I have not
many varieties, but when I left the country
last fall, the tenth of November, although ice
nearly an inch in thickness had formed, there
were Roses still in bloom in the garden.</p>

<p>The very hardy Roses, which, with a few
exceptions, bloom only in June and early
July, with an occasional flower in the autumn,
should be planted together, as they
need but slight covering. In late November
the hardy ones get about a foot of stable
litter over the beds. The everblooming
kinds have six inches of manure, then a
foot of leaves, and then a good covering of
cedar branches over all. But cover late and
uncover early (the very minute the frost is
out of the ground), or your Roses will die.</p>

<p>If asked to name, from my own experience,
the best dozen Roses, I should say the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
following were the most satisfactory: General
Jacqueminot, Jubilee, Ulrich Brunner,
Madame Plantier, Clothilde Soupert, Kaiserin
Augusta Victoria, La France, Mrs. Robert
Garrett, Princess Alice de Monaco, Soleil
d&#8217;Or, Perle des Jardins, and Mrs. John Laing
or Baroness Rothschild. Paul Neyron and
Prince Camille de Rohan might also be
added to the list.</p>

<p>Between Mrs. John Laing and Baroness
Rothschild, it is a toss-up. Mrs. John Laing
is a healthy, strong Rose, and a most constant
bloomer. But none that grows is
more beautiful than the Baroness Rothschild.
Rather a shy bloomer; still each Rose, on its
long, strong stem, surrounded by the very
fine foliage that distinguishes this variety,
makes a bouquet in itself. Baroness Rothschild
is also vigorous, and I have never seen
it attacked by the enemies of most Roses.</p>

<p>Climbing Roses have so much use, as well
as beauty, in a garden, that my advice is,
wherever there is an excuse for having one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
plant it there. They do finely on the south
side of a house, on arches, summer-houses
and trellises. I have a trellis along one
side of a grass walk three hundred and fifty
feet long. At each post are planted two
Roses, a Crimson Rambler and a Wichuraiana.
The Wichuraiana blossoms when the
Rambler is done. Imagine the beauty of
this trellis when the Roses are in bloom!
On the other side of this walk there is a
border four feet wide, with shrubs at the
back, filled, all of the three hundred and
fifty feet, with many varieties of perennials,
also with Lilies and annuals planted in
wherever a foot of space can be found.</p>

<p>All of the Ramblers are good, but none
blooms so luxuriantly as the crimson. The
Climbing Clothilde Soupert, Baltimore Belle
and Climbing Wootton are also fine. Of
the Wichuraiana Hybrids, Jersey Beauty and
Evergreen Gem are the best. The foliage
is lovely, and the perfume of the flowers
delicious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>The Climbing Roses should be yearly enriched
in the spring with manure and bone-meal,
and, after two years, some old wood
should be cut out every autumn. Many of
the Crimson Ramblers and Wichuraiana in
my garden made growth last summer of
splendid great canes, larger around than
one&#8217;s thumb and from ten to fourteen feet
long. Monday was the day for tying and
training the Roses, and often it seemed
impossible for them to grow so much in a
week. It would have been incredible, had
we not the actual proof before our eyes.</p>

<h2>LILIES</h2>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="head noindent center">CHAPTER XI</p>

<p class="noindent center">LILIES</p>

<p>Lilies, too, should have a book for themselves.
My knowledge of them is slight.
<i>Lilium auratum</i> (Auratum Lily), the grandest
of all Lilies, disappears after a few years.
If large-sized bulbs are bought there will
be the first year from twenty to thirty Lilies
on a stalk four feet high, the second year
seven to ten, the third year perhaps two
or three, but oftener none at all. If you
then dig for the bulb, lo! it is gone. The
expense, therefore, of these Lilies is great,
from their having to be often renewed.
Still, do not fail to have them, if possible,
for nothing can take their place. They bloom
from the middle of July for about a month.</p>

<p>I wrote to an authority on Lilies to ask
the cause of this disappearance. He told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
me that, as soon as planted in this country,
a microbe disease attacked them and they
gradually disappeared under its ravages. Botanists
surely should find a specific, or antidote
for this; but perhaps, like some of the
most terrible diseases of the human being,
it evades all research. Miss Jekyll, in her
book on Lilies for English Gardens, in speaking
of <i>Lilium auratum</i> says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="small">&#8220;This grand Lily, well planted, and left
alone for three years, will probably then
be at its best. After this the bulbs will
be likely to have increased so much that
it will be well to divide them.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>This would seem to imply that the Auratums
thrive in England. Well, they have
climate in England, even if we have weather,
and English gardens will always fill American
gardeners with despair.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ill_f_140" id="ill_f_140"></a>
<img src="images/ill_f_140.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="349" />
<p class="caption"><i>Lilium auratum</i> growing behind Peonies and Columbines that bloomed earlier<br />
August tenth</p>
</div>

<p><i>Lilium candidum</i>, which blooms before the
other Lilies, is hardy and fragrant and increases
rapidly. These Lilies must have full
sun and light soil. About every three or four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>years they can be separated, which should
be done as soon as the stalks turn yellow,
as the bulb makes an autumn growth. For
this reason the Candidums must always be
bought and planted by the tenth of September.
Other Lilies may be planted in the
spring, when the frost leaves the ground,
or in October.</p>

<p><i>Lilium speciosum rubrum</i> thrives and increases
in our climate, needs a partly shaded
location and, therefore, does well when
planted among Rhododendrons. It blooms
after the Auratum, the end of August
and first two weeks of September.</p>

<p><i>Lilium speciosum album</i> blooms at the
same time as <i>Lilium rubrum</i>. It is a beautiful
pure white Lily with wax-like curved
petals, grows best in full sun, and averages
six Lilies on a stalk, although I have often
counted more.</p>

<p><i>Lilium longiflorum</i> blooms early in July.
These lilies are very much like the Bermuda
Lily, except that they have, as a rule, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
four blossoms on a stalk, and are hardy. In
my garden they have not increased.</p>

<p><i>Hansoni</i>, a Japanese Lily, flowering in
June; bright yellow in color; perfectly
hardy and very desirable.</p>

<p><i>Lilium Canadense</i> (the Meadow Lily), yellow,
red and orange, increases, and is very
satisfactory, but likes as moist a situation as
possible.</p>

<p><i>Tigrinum</i>, the old Tiger Lilies, both single
and double. These bloom in July, increase
rapidly, and by planting, when fully
ripened, the little black bulbils which form
on the stalk, any number of bulbs can be
raised.</p>

<p><i>Funkia subcordata</i> is the old-fashioned
white Day Lily of our grandmothers&#8217; gardens.
The broad leaves of this plant are
almost as handsome as the spikes of bloom.
These Lilies flower best when grown in the
sun, but then the leaves turn yellow&mdash;so
give them a partly shaded place.</p>

<p><i>Funkia c&aelig;rulea</i>, with the blue blossom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
is worthy of a place in the garden, though
far from being as effective as the white-flowered
variety. I also grow the kind with
the small white and green variegated leaves
for the sake of the foliage, so useful in
house decoration.</p>

<p>Funkias are not, botanically speaking,
Lilies, but are mentioned in this chapter
because popularly known as Day Lilies and
on account of the lily-like form of their
blossoms.</p>

<p><i>Lily-of-the-valley</i> should have a place in
every garden. Absolutely hardy, requiring
no care, it blooms prolifically in early May,
fills the air with its fragrance, and is beloved
by every one. The German name for this
flower, Mai Gl&#246;cken (May Bells) is particularly
appropriate. I have heard of one
woman whose bed of these flowers, four feet
by fifty feet, has yielded as many as twenty
thousand sprays in one season. The pips
can be set out the end of October or the
beginning of November. If the bed is quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
large, when the Lilies have finished blooming,
some can be lifted here and there and
transplanted. As the pips increase rapidly,
their places will soon be filled. Lilies-of-the-valley
do best in a partially shaded place,
and require a deep, rich soil, well mixed with
leaf-mould.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Lily bed should be prepared, if the
place is damp and drainage not good, by
digging out the soil for three feet, and putting
a foot of cobblestones in the bottom;
then fill up with a mixture of good soil, leaf-mould
and sand, and very old, well-rotted
manure. In the ordinary garden that is not
wet, two feet are enough to dig out the
bed, and the cobblestones can be omitted.
Lilies should always be set with a handful
of sand around the bulb, to prevent any
possibility of manure coming in contact with
it, as the manure will destroy the bulb.</p>

</div>

<p>In my garden there is no special place prepared
for the Lilies, but they are grown in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>all the borders, the <i>Rubrums</i> in the shade,
the others in the sun, and this year there
have been thousands of them. If there are
no woods near, where the men can gather
leaf-mould, have the rakings of the autumn
leaves put in a pile, cover with boards, and
occasionally during the spring and summer
have them well forked over; the next autumn
there will be a quantity of the finest thing
for Lilies, Rhododendrons, Ferns, or indeed
any kind of plant. This should be mixed in
a pile in the proportion of one wheelbarrow
of mould, two of good soil, two coal-scuttlefuls
of wood-ashes, one-half barrow of old
manure and two spadefuls of fine bone-meal.
There is also nothing better for the Roses
than some of this mixture.</p>

<p>All Lilies do better if well mulched with
clippings of lawn grass or with very old
manure.</p>

<p>The varieties of Lilies mentioned are the
easiest grown and the most satisfactory.</p>

<p>Lilies should always be planted in clumps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of the same kind&mdash;never less than six, and
the number increased according to the size
of the garden. Alternate clumps of a dozen
each of <i>Lilium auratum</i> and <i>Lilium album</i>
planted in a border just behind Foxgloves
and Canterbury Bells will come into bloom
when these two biennials have finished, the
<i>Auratum</i> first, then the <i>Album</i>; these four
flowers will keep the border gay from early
in June until the middle of September.</p>

<p>Lilies should be planted about eight inches
deep, and have a covering of litter late in
the autumn.</p>

<h2>SPRING-FLOWERING BULBS</h2>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="head noindent center">CHAPTER XII</p>

<p class="noindent center">SPRING-FLOWERING BULBS</p>

<p>Bulbs can be planted at any time in the
autumn before the ground freezes; the
first week in November is as good a time
as any. The cost of Tulips, Narcissi and
Daffodils is not great. They multiply and
need not be disturbed for three or four
years.</p>

<p><i>Snowdrops.</i> The earliest of all flowers to
bloom is the Snowdrop. After the long, cold
winter, with the melting of the snow and
the first suspicion of milder air, these frail
beauties send up their graceful bells of white.
With what triumph the first one is found
and brought to the house, and what a thrill
of joy it gives to know that spring will soon
be here! Snowdrops can be planted thickly
in the borders and also, like Crocuses, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the grass. The foliage of both will die
before it is time to mow the lawn.</p>

<p><i>Crocuses</i>, which should be planted in the
grass, will begin to bloom as soon as the
Snowdrops pass. The gay little things
make the lawn, while still brown, a carpet
of bright colors. I heard of a gentleman
who planted ten thousand of them in this
way, and was rewarded by a most beautiful
display at a time when there were no other
flowers.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ill_f_151" id="ill_f_151"></a>

<p class="caption">Garden arch, covered with Japanese gourds<br />
August twenty-seventh</p>
</div>

<p><i>Tulips</i> I plant everywhere in the borders
about four inches apart, all kinds, such as
single, double, Gesnerianas and Parrot Tulips;
but always a quantity of only one kind together.
The bed where later the Salvias are
put, has three hundred Golden Yellow Tulips.
When these have faded, the Salvia plants are
set out in the same bed, without disturbing
the bulbs. This can be done if the men are
careful, and when the Tulip leaves are quite
yellow they are cut off (for unless allowed
to ripen the bulb does not grow and multiply).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>Every three years all Tulips are dug
up in the autumn, after the Salvias have
died; the bed is then made very rich, and the
Tulips reset. There are generally more than
enough to refill the bed. The same treatment
is pursued in the Canna bed, only
here the Tulips are double white.</p>

<p>Tulips will bloom from April twentieth
until the last of May, if both the very early
as well as the late kinds are planted. The
late varieties are the Parrot and Gesneriana,
which latter grow two feet high and are
very showy.</p>

<p>I have been constantly surprised to find
that many good gardeners take up all bulbs
when through flowering in the spring, store
through the summer and replant in the
autumn. This is not only unnecessary, but
it is better for the bulbs to remain in the
ground as nature intended. Mine have always
been so treated and have been successful.</p>

<p>In planting bulbs in newly prepared soil,
great care must be taken that they do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
come in contact with manure. To prevent
this, the man should have a box of sand,
in a handful of which each bulb should
be set. Spring-flowering bulbs should be
planted about four inches deep.</p>

<p><i>Poeticus Narcissus</i> and <i>Daffodils</i>, both
single and double, do well when naturalized
in grass that need not be cut until
the foliage of the bulb has died in June.
They also make a very good edging for a
border along a walk.</p>

<p>The single Van Sion and Emperor Narcissus
are excellent varieties. The old-fashioned
sweet-scented Jonquil and double
Van Sion, or Double Yellow Daffodil, are
as satisfactory as any of the numerous kinds
named in the catalogues. One early spring,
the Double Yellow Daffodils were all in
bloom on the tenth of April.</p>

<p>Narcissi and Daffodils live for generations.
I know some double yellow Daffodils growing
in my great-grandfather&#8217;s garden, that were
planted over seventy years ago. The place was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
sold and the house burned about thirty years
since, and all this time has been entirely
neglected. Some one told me that Daffodils
and Narcissi still bloomed there bravely in
the grass. With a cousin, one lovely day
last spring, I took the train out to this old
place and there found quantities of the dainty
yellow flowers. We had come unprovided
with any gardening implements, having nothing
of the kind in town, and brought only a
basket for the spoils, and a steel table-knife.
We quickly found the knife of no avail, so
borrowed a sadly broken coal-shovel from
a tumble-down sort of a man who stood gazing
at us from the door of a tumble-down
house. The roots of the Daffodils were very
deep, and neither of us could use a spade, so
the driver of the ramshackle wagon taken
at the station was pressed into service.
Handling of shovel or spade was evidently
an unknown art to him. The Daffodil roots
were nearly a foot deep, but we finally got
them, several hundreds of them, all we could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
carry. The driver seemed to think us somewhat
mad and said &#8220;Them&#8217;s only some kind
of weed,&#8221; but when I told him the original
bulbs from which all these had come were
planted by my great-grandmother and her
daughter, and that I wanted to carry some
away, to plant in my own garden, he became
interested and dug with all his heart.
The bulbs were in solid clumps a foot across
and had to be pulled apart and separated.
They were the old Double Yellow Daffodil
and a very large double white variety, the
edges of the petals faintly tinged with yellow
and delightfully fragrant. My share of the
spoils is now thriving in my garden. By
the process of division every three years,
these Daffodils can be made to yield indefinitely,
and perhaps some great-grandchild of
my own may gather their blossoms.</p>

<p class="caption">Vase of Phlox; single blossoms actual size<br />

</div>

<p><i>Hyacinths</i>, too, should have a place in
the spring garden. They are more expensive,
as a rule, than Tulips, Narcissi and
Daffodils, but, in large or small quantities,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>are well worth the money. The single varieties
are generally preferred, while, of all
kinds, the white and pale blue are the
loveliest.</p>

<p>Nothing in the garden gives so much
pleasure as the early spring flowers. Perhaps
this is because they are the first to
bloom. Every one knows how beautiful the
first lovely Dandelion seems, gold-starring
the new grass. Many bulbs can be had for
little money, and I would say to all, plant
as many as you can squeeze in. From April
fifteenth to May fifteenth I receive in town,
twice a week, great boxes of spring flowers
from my garden, enough each time to fill
sixteen to twenty vases; yet my orders to
the men are to cut always so that the flowers
cannot be missed from the garden.</p>

<p>Of the hundreds of shrubs, comparatively
few survive the severe winter climate of
interior New York, or grow very luxuriantly.</p>

<p>Lilacs of all varieties, white and purple,
single and double; Deutzias, white and pink;
and Syringa, the improved large-flowered
variety, are most beautiful. <i>Spir&aelig;a Van
Houttei</i>, sometimes called Bridal Wreath,
with its long trails of white blossoms; and
<i>Viburnum plicatum</i>, or Japanese Snowball,
which in late May bears a ball of bloom on
every twig and is both healthy and hardy,
are also desirable shrubs. The old variety
of Snowball is attacked by a blight, the
leaves curl up and grow black and the
blooms are imperfect. A few years ago I
dug up all of mine and burned them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Altheas, or Rose of Sharon,&mdash;not by any
means the old purplish red variety, but the
beautiful new double white and double pale
pink kinds, with blossoms coming in August
and reminding one of Camellias,&mdash;are indispensable.
Do not fail to have <i>Hydrangea
paniculata</i>, with its great heads of white
bloom, slowly changing to dull pink, and
lasting quite six weeks.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Hydrangea paniculata grandiflora</i><br />

</div>

<p>Japanese Barberry, a dwarf shrub, covered
in autumn with scarlet berries which remain
on the bush all winter, is very ornamental.
Many of us remember <i>Calycanthus floridus</i>, or
the Sweet-scented Shrub of our young days,
when the children would tie two or three
of the queer brown blossoms in the corner
of a handkerchief to regale their less fortunate
companions with a sniff of the delicious
odor. <i>Forsythia</i> and <i>Laburnum</i>, or Golden
Chain, both have yellow blossoms. Others
are, <i>Weigela Rosea</i>, the well-known pink-flowering
shrub; <i>Rhus Cotinus</i>, or Purple
Fringe, and <i>Cydonia Japonica</i>, or Japanese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>Quince, deep rose-pink, flowering early in
the spring.</p>

<p>These all yield beautiful flowers, beside
being hardy and of rapid growth.</p>

<p>All shrubs should be trimmed as soon as
they have finished flowering, but only enough
to prevent their becoming spindling, with the
exception of <i>Hydrangea grandiflora</i>, which
should be trimmed back, at least three-quarters
of the new growth, every year.</p>

<p>It is important, also, to thin out the old
wood of most shrubs after five or six years.</p>

<p>Shrubs can be grown from cuttings if one
has patience to wait for the result. But as
it takes from three to four years&#8217; time and
considerable care to grow a shrub that would
cost but twenty cents, for which price many
varieties of shrubs can be bought, few
people care to raise them.</p>

<p>On a large place it might be worth while
to raise shrubs from cuttings. And where
there is plenty of space, a small nursery of
them might be kept.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of June take clippings about
a foot long, make a shallow trench in
good ground and plant them a couple of
inches deep. They should be well rooted, in
about six weeks. If the weather be dry,
after planting them, they must be watered
daily. The following spring they should be
reset, a foot apart, where they can grow
until transplanted to their final resting
place. I know a beautiful hedge of <i>Cydonia
Japonica</i>, or Japanese Quince, that has been
grown from cuttings. Privet can easily be
grown from cuttings, and I have raised Box
from clippings. Fortunately, the season was
a wet one, for if allowed to become dry
before being well rooted, they would probably
have died.</p>

<p class="center small"><span class="smcap">List of Most Satisfactory Shrubs</span></p>

<p><i>Altheas</i>, pink or white; blooms in August.
Jeanne d&#8217;Arc, pure double white, the best.
Grows six to eight feet in five years; must
be trimmed in October.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Berberis Thunbergii</i>, or Barberry, of slow
growth; about three feet high; desirable for
its beautiful foliage and scarlet fruit in
winter.</p>

<p><i>Calycanthus floridus</i>, or Sweet-scented
Shrub. It yields its brown blossoms the
end of May; slow-growing; requires but
little trimming; height, five to six feet.</p>

<p><i>Cydonia Japonica</i>, Japanese Quince, has
brilliant red blossoms in early May; grows
six to seven feet high.</p>

<p><i>Deutzia crenata</i>, variety of pale pink, and
<i>Candidissima</i>, white; of rapid growth, and
very high; six to eight feet in five years.</p>

<p><i>Forsythia</i> blooms in April with masses
of yellow flowers; moderate, quick growth;
seldom over six feet high.</p>

<p><i>Hydrangea paniculata grandiflora</i>, the
finest of all hardy shrubs. The flowers
are great panicles of white. They bloom
about the first of August and remain beautiful
for six weeks, slowly changing to a
soft, dull pink. This shrub is most effective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
when grown in masses of a dozen or
more, although single specimens are very
fine. They must be vigorously cut back
late every fall, leaving only about six inches
of new growth.</p>

<p><i>Lilac</i>, common purple and common white;
also <i>Marie Legray</i>, a fine white Lilac, and
<i>Madame Lemoine</i>, a new double variety bearing
very large trusses of flowers. All of
these varieties of Lilac grow high and rapidly&mdash;frequently
eight feet in six years. They
require little or no pruning. It is sufficient
to cut the blossoms either before or after
they go to seed.</p>

<p><i>Lonicera rosea</i> and <i>Lonicera albida</i>, upright
Honeysuckles, in shrub form, vigorous,
quick-growing, requiring but slight pruning
in late autumn. They flower in May, and
in midsummer are covered with beautiful
berries.</p>

<p><i>Magnolia conspicua</i>, with large white blossoms,
blooms the middle of April; <i>Soulangeana</i>
has large pink flowers and blossoms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the end of April. Magnolias should be
pruned when set out, and should be moved
only in spring.</p>

<p><i>Philadelphus syringa</i>, or Mock Orange;
<i>grandiflorus</i> is the finest. The flowers are
pure white, very fragrant and bloom about
the middle of June. The shrub grows high,
is perfectly hardy and in every way satisfactory.
It should be trimmed as soon as it
has finished blossoming. Cut back about
three-quarters of the new growth; it will
then send out side shoots and become
continually thicker.</p>

<p><i>Privet.</i> The common Privet is of very
rapid growth and excellent for a screen. It
should be trimmed the end of June, but only
enough to prevent its becoming scraggly.
The California Privet is not so hardy.</p>

<p><i>Rhus Cotinus</i>, popularly known as Smoke
Tree or Purple Fringe, grows as high as a
small tree and requires almost no pruning.
In midsummer it is covered with fine,
mist-like, purple flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Spir&aelig;a Van Houttei.</i> This is one of the
most satisfactory shrubs; is rather dwarf in
habit, growing about five feet high. The end
of May it is covered with clusters of white
flowers on long, pendulous branches. Trim
as soon as it has finished blooming, cutting
off about half of the new growth.</p>

<p><i>Spir&aelig;a Anthony Waterer,</i> another Spirea,
very dwarf, only about a foot in height, and
covered with bright crimson flowers from
June to October.</p>

<p><i>Viburnum plicatum,</i> Japan Snowball, one
of the finest shrubs. It grows about six
feet high, and is completely covered with
its balls of snow in early June. It requires
comparatively little trimming.</p>

<p><i>Weigela.</i>&mdash;The two most satisfactory varieties
of this shrub are <i>Candida</i>, whose
blossoms are white, and <i>Rosea</i>, with pink
flowers. They bloom most freely about the
tenth of June, when each shrub becomes a
mass of flowers. Care must be taken to
cut out the old wood from time to time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and to trim after the shrub has finished
blooming.</p>

<p class="center small"><span class="smcap">A Few Evergreen Shrubs</span></p>

<p>Of evergreen shrubs, <i>Kalmia latifolia</i>,
or Mountain Laurel, is most satisfactory,
growing three to four feet high. It is covered
in early June with large clusters of pale
pink and white flowers.</p>

<p><i>Rhododendron maximum</i>, the large-leaved
hardy American variety. Under cultivation
this shrub seldom grows more than six feet
high; in the woods it is found much larger.</p>

<p><i>Japanese Holly</i>, a dense-growing shrub
about four feet high, with deep glossy green
foliage.</p>

<p><i>Tree Box</i>, generally trimmed in standard
or pyramidal form and very slow-growing.</p>

<p><i>Bignonia radicans</i>, Trumpet Creeper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

of any size without considering the question
of water. Within the limits of a town
supply there is only the comparatively simple
matter of laying the pipes. But when the
place is dependent upon its own water system,
the amount to be counted upon and the
situation of the garden with reference to the
source of supply must be seriously considered.
If possible the garden hydrants should not
be more than fifty feet apart. This greatly
facilitates watering. When further apart,
plants are in danger of being injured by the
unwieldy hose. A nozzle that will regulate
the flow of water from a fine spray to a
strong stream will be found convenient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>
<p>Opinions differ upon the best way to lay
water-pipes through a place, some preferring
to put them but a foot under ground, and
turn off the water in winter; others lay them
in trenches three and a half to four feet deep,
so that they are beyond all danger from frost.
This latter plan was followed in my garden and
I recommend it as being most satisfactory.</p>

<p>The watering of a garden requires nearly
as much judgment as the seasoning of a
soup. Keep the soil well stirred and loose
on the surface, going through the garden,
where possible, with a rake; and if there is
no room for a rake, stir gently with a trowel
every five days or once a week. In this
way moisture will be retained in the soil,
since the loose earth acts as a mulch.</p>

<p>When watering, be generous. Soak the
plants to the roots; wet all the earth around
them, and do it late in the afternoon, when
the sun is low. How often have I been
obliged to chide the men for watering too
early in the afternoon, and not doing it thoroughly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>for, upon stirring the ground, I
would find that the water had penetrated
but a couple of inches. During long periods
of dry weather, the garden, without water,
will simply wither and burn.</p>

<p>Rhododendrons, Ferns and Lilies suffer
in dry time, even though well mulched, and
must be kept moist.</p>

<p>Japanese Iris blooms but indifferently
unless quite wet.</p>

<p>When dry weather continues for a long
period I divide the garden into three parts;
one part is thoroughly watered every evening,
and the following day the soil is stirred.
In this way the plants suffer comparatively
little. For years we had no water supply
through the gardens, and really, in dry
weather, life had no pleasure for me because
of my unhappiness at the sight of the
withered garden. I would drag watering-cans
about, and beg and bribe all the family
to do likewise. Every afternoon, about five
o&#8217;clock, one of the men would fill eight ten-gallon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
milk-cans with water, put them in
a wagon, and drive about the place watering
the flower beds and borders. Frequently
he would fill these cans three times in one
afternoon. This, as may be imagined, was
slow and unsatisfactory work, and, except in
the case of a small garden, is too great a task.</p>

<p>Often in a dry time, after dinner, I bethink
me of the Rhododendrons or Ferns or Iris,
or some other plants to which drought means
death, and I feel sure &#8220;that boy has not
watered them enough.&#8221; Then, in ten minutes
the garden skirt, shoes and gloves are
on, and those thirsty plants get a drenching
to their very roots such as they would never
receive from any perfunctory &#8220;boy&#8221; or gardener.
I go to bed warm and weary, yet
sleep is sweet from satisfaction at the
thought of the garden&#8217;s happiness.</p>

<p class="center">WALKS</p>

<p>Unquestionably, walks near the house
should be graveled; they naturally have too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
hard usage to keep turf in good condition.
Graveled walks should be dug out a foot or
more in depth, filled in with broken stone,
this covered well with coarse gravel, and
finished with a coating of a couple of inches
of whatever fine gravel is chosen. A walk
thus made will be dry and well drained
and weeds have little chance to grow.</p>

<p>The most beautiful walks of all are those
of grass. Strange to say, they are seldom
seen in this country. Through any garden,
some little distance from the house, where
they will be walked on only by those going
to the garden, the turf-walks, with ordinary
care, will last well, require only the usual
cutting with the lawn-mower, and, especially
if edged with Box, should be the very pride
and joy of the possessor&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p>The ground for such walks should be spaded
deeply with plenty of manure, raked carefully
and made very smooth. Prepare in
September, and by the fifteenth or twentieth
sow, very thickly, a mixture of one-third
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
each to the bushel of Kentucky Blue
Grass, Long Island Bent Grass and Red
Top. Roll thoroughly, and if the weather
be dry have the newly sown paths sprinkled
daily and kept moist. The tender grass
should appear in two weeks, and will
continue to grow during October.</p>

</div>

<p>About Thanksgiving time of the first year,
cover with a layer of straw, and uncover
about the twenty-fifth of March. At this
time it is well to sow thinly some more
grass seed of the same kinds, and again roll,
the reason for the additional spring sowing
being to replace any of the grass that may
have been winter-killed. About the twentieth
of April spread cotton-seed meal, the
best of all fertilizers for grass, all over the
paths. For years we have had the lawns
covered with stable manure in February
and raked off the first of April, and for
years I have waged war with the weeds
and wild grasses. But sow cotton-seed meal
early in April, and if possible give the paths
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>a little wood-ashes in June; the result will
be a hundred per cent better than from the
use of manure. Cotton-seed meal should not
be sown too thickly, and wood-ashes must
be spread thinly, so as not to burn the
grass.</p>

<p>The men tell me that a sharp-pointed
mason&#8217;s trowel is more satisfactory than any
other tool for removing weeds from the
lawns and grass paths. If this is carefully
attended to the end of May, and again the
latter part of June, and only artificial fertilizer
used, there will be but little trouble
with weeds in the grass.</p>

<p class="center">BOX-EDGING</p>

<p>Box-edging should be set out in the
spring, that it may be thoroughly rooted
before winter.</p>

<p>Great care must be taken in setting out
the Box, that the row be absolutely straight
and even. The garden cord is carefully
stretched; a shallow, narrow trench is dug
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
with the spade, and then the little plants
are placed about three inches apart, each
plant against the string. The trench is half
filled in with earth, then a layer of manure,
and finally more earth packed down.
Box planted in this way should grow and
thrive, especially if given, along in May, a
little bone-meal.</p>

August second</p>
</div>

<p>I write feelingly of Box-edging to-day.
Last week, Holy Week, I spent in the
country, and most of my time was passed
on my knees. For, when not at church or
driving the intervening five miles, I was setting
out plants in the garden, and that, like
one&#8217;s prayers, requires kneeling. Four men
were working, setting out plants and trees,
but the earth was so sweet and warm and
brown that it was impossible to keep away
from it. With trowel in hand and joy in
my heart, I set out hundreds of little Box
plants, transplanted Columbines, Foxgloves
and Canterbury Bells. Big robins were hopping
tamely about, calling to one another;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>blackbirds and meadow-larks were singing
their refrains; the brave plants were pushing
their way through the earth to new life, and
I thought how good it was to be alive, to
have a garden to dig in, and, above all, to
be well and able to dig.</p>

<p>With work in the garden care and worry
vanish. The cook (as some cooks of mine
have done) may announce that &#8220;&#8217;tis a woild
waste of a place. I be lavin&#8217; the mornin&#8217;.&#8221;
The hamper of meat does not arrive on the
one train from town, or somebody smashes
something very dear to your heart,&mdash;just go
to the garden, tie up some Roses or vines,
or poke about with a trowel, and though
murder may have been in your thoughts, in
half an hour serenity will return. And what
does it all matter, anyway? Another maid
can cook for a few days, and there are
always bacon and eggs.</p>

<p>Philosophy is inevitably learned in a garden.
Speaking of eggs, I think of hens.
Living on a farm, of course there have always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
been hens and chickens. These creatures
were provided with houses and yards
and fences, and given every inducement to
remain where they belonged; yet with diabolical
ingenuity they would escape from their
quarters, dig under the fence, fly over it, or
some one would leave a door or a gate open,
and then, with one accord, all the flock would
make for the gardens and scratch and roll
in the borders. This sort of thing happened
repeatedly, until I felt there must be a
league between the farmer&#8217;s wife and the
hens. But the limit of endurance was
reached when, one afternoon, coming out to
look at a bed of several dozen Chrysanthemums
set out in the morning, I found the
poor plants all scratched out of the ground,
broken and wilted. Then in wrath the fiat
went forth, &#8220;No more hens on this farm,
those on hand to be eaten at once.&#8221; For
days a patient family had hen soup, hen
croquettes, hen salad and hen fricassee, until
the last culprit came to her end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">SUN-DIAL</p>

<p>There is no more charming and interesting
addition to a garden than a sun-dial.
For hundreds of years sun-dials have been
used as timekeepers, and though some of
the very old ones were occasionally set into
the fa&#231;ade of a building, they are generally
found in the <i>plaisaunce</i> or garden, mounted
upon quaint pedestals. Sun-dials are supposed,
by their owners, to keep accurate
time, but it must be remembered that there
is always a difference between clock-time
and sun-time. While, to-day, our lives are
frequently portioned into minutes, and it
would seem as if one might loiter and be
lazy in a garden, if anywhere, still even
among the flowers we find a &#8220;<i>tempus
fugit</i>.&#8221; For a time after my sun-dial was
set, it was amusing to notice how often,
about half after eleven o&#8217;clock, and again
at five, this late addition to the garden
would claim the attention of the workmen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>My sun-dial stands in the center of a
formal garden where four paths meet, forming
a circle twenty feet across. The pedestal
is a simple column of marble, four and one-half
feet high, slightly tapering toward the
top, with beveled corners. This is placed
on a stone foundation three and one-half feet
deep, laid in cement. The pedestal I found
at the yard of a second-hand building-material
man, on Avenue B, in New York city.
After it had been set in place, I wanted it
rubbed up and a chipped place smoothed.
The only available man for this work, was
the gravestone-cutter from the nearest town.
When he was recognized at work in the
garden by passing countrymen, they supposed,
of course, that some one was buried
there, and many have been the inquiries as
to &#8220;whose be that mouny-ment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crimson Rambler Roses twine about the
pedestal. At the corners of the four paths
are standard Box trees, which stand like
sentinels, and between them there are Bay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
trees in terra-cotta vases of simple shape&mdash;copies
of antique ones.</p>

<p>The dial made for the latitude bears this
inscription, &#8220;<i>Utere praesenti, memor ultimae</i>&#8221;
(Use the present hour, mindful of the last),
which I found in an old book on sun-dials
in the Avery Library, at Columbia
University.</p>

<p class="center">PERGOLA</p>

<p>Across the end of this garden is a rustic
pergola seventy feet long, made of cedar
posts cut from the woods on the farm, ten
posts on a side, each post being set four
feet deep. A string-piece of heavy chestnut
rests on the tops of each row of posts. Cedar
poles ten inches apart extend across the top
and project two feet over each side. The
pergola is eight feet wide and ten feet high,
is easy to build and very effective. Care
must be taken to set the posts at least four
feet. At each post are planted a two-year-old
root of Wistaria and one of Virginia
Creeper, and I live in the hope of some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
day seeing the vines cover the pergola.
The ground slopes gently where this is built,
and the first autumn after it was made, it
looked, from a little distance, so much like
a section of an elevated railroad as to be
very depressing. But one must possess imagination
to be a gardener, and have the ability
to see the garden as it will look &#8220;next year.&#8221;
So I refused to see the pergola except as
clothed with vines, and in May, with the
beautiful racemes of Purple Wistaria hanging
from every rafter.</p>

<p>Patience and perseverance are traits necessary
to the gardener. One must not be
discouraged, but determined to succeed. If
a set of plants die, or do not flourish this
year, try them again next season, under
different conditions, until the difficulties
are overcome. I have known people who
began gardening as a mere pastime when
over forty years old, and who have told
me what an absorbing interest it had become
and how greatly it changed the whole aspect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
of life for them in the country. What
a delightful tie, fondness for gardening makes
between people! I know several men with
beautiful places and lovely gardens in which
they take the warmest personal interest.
Whenever I meet one of them at dinner,
if by chance I am not seated next
to him, I am unhappy and cannot listen
sympathetically, either to the enthusiasm of
the man on one side whose heart is, perhaps,
bound up in golf, or to the laments of
my neighbor on the other, who may be suffering
from rheumatism or gout, and unable
to eat or drink what he wants.</p>

<h2>INSECTICIDES&mdash;TOOL-ROOM</h2>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="head noindent center">CHAPTER XV</p>

<p class="center">INSECTICIDES&mdash;TOOL-ROOM</p>

<p>The enemies of growing things have
certainly increased alarmingly of late
years. I cannot recall that formerly any
insect was to be found in either vegetable or
flower garden, other than the potato bug,
currant-worm, cabbage-worm, and the green
worm and small black beetle on the Rose;
but now there are so many horrid creatures
lying in wait until a plant is in perfection,
to cut the stalk, or eat the root, or eat the
pith from the stalk so that it falls, or to
devour the leaves and eat the blossoms,
that insecticides and a spraying machine are
as necessary to a garden as a spade. For
a small garden a spraying machine holding
from a couple of quarts to a gallon, can be
bought for a trifling sum, that will answer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the purpose very well For a larger garden,
a good air-pump, costing from five dollars
upwards, will be found an excellent
investment.</p>

<p>One of the best insecticides is Bordeaux
mixture, which can either be bought or made.
I have twenty-five gallons made at a time
and keep it always on hand. The following
is the receipe:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">Three pounds of blue vitriol in coarse crystals;
three pounds of unslaked lime. Slake the lime
in two and one-half gallons of water; pour two and
one-half gallons of water over the blue vitriol in
another receptacle, and let both stand over night.
In the morning stir the blue vitriol until all is dissolved;
then let two persons pour simultaneously
the lime water and the blue vitriol into the same receptacle,
and add twenty gallons of water; stir
well before filling the spraying machine.</p></blockquote>

<img src="images/ill_f_190.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="390" />
<p class="caption">The Pergola (first summer)<br />
August twenty-fifth</p>
</div>

<p>Bordeaux mixture is to be used for rust,
mildew, and all kinds of blight, whenever
the leaves of plants have a tendency to
turn black. Hollyhocks seem to be universally
attacked by rust. Spraying the plants
at the end of April, and again in the
middle of May, should entirely prevent this.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>I have found that Bordeaux mixture prevents
the leaves of Monkshood from turning black
and falling off, if the plants are well sprayed
with it about the middle of June and the
first of July.</p>

<p>Phloxes grown in rather shady places will,
in damp weather, fall victims to mildew on
the leaves. Spraying with Bordeaux mixture
the end of June and middle of July
should prevent this. Roses also have a tendency
in warm, damp weather to mildew,
which can be prevented by spraying the
plants with Bordeaux mixture.</p>

<p>Kerosene emulsion may also be prepared,
and is excellent for killing, both the small
green aphids that often cover the leaves of
Roses, and other hard, scaly insects. Following
is the receipe:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">Put one cake of laundry soap shaved fine into one
gallon of water. When dissolved, add two gallons
of kerosene oil. This makes the emulsion.</p></blockquote>

<p>For spraying, use one quart of the emulsion
in fourteen quarts of water. Be sure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
that this is very thoroughly mixed before
filling the sprayer.</p>

<p>Powdered hellebore, if dissolved in the
proportion of one pound of powder to one
gallon of water, will destroy both the green
worm on the Rose leaf and the small dark
beetle that eats the Roses. It will also
dispose of green worms on other plants.</p>

<p>Slug-shot dissolved, one-half pound of
powder to one gallon of water, will, if used
the latter part of April and several times in
May, keep the Roses comparatively free
from insects. Slug-shot and hellebore may
also be used dry and blown on to the plants
with a bellows.</p>

<p>I have used Hellebore in my garden for
many years without harm to anything except
the worms and beetles. But recently I
heard of a lady who was severely poisoned
in using dry Hellebore. The wind blew it
into her face; perhaps some was inhaled,
and serious illness resulted. I mention the
fact here, to caution all who use it not to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
let either the spray or the powder come in
contact with the skin. Some persons may
be susceptible to the poison while others are
not,&mdash;presenting a case of what the doctors
call an &#8220;idiosyncrasy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Paris green, mixed in the proportion of
two tablespoonfuls to three quarts of water
and used as a spray, will destroy a beetle
that sometimes appears upon the Gourd
vines.</p>

<p>Tobacco water will kill the black aphids
which appear on the stems and leaves of
hardy Chrysanthemums. It will also kill
green aphids. This spray is made by filling
an ordinary pail lightly, not pressed
down, with tobacco stems. Pour as much
cold water into the pail as it will hold;
let it stand for three hours, when it is
ready to use in the spraying machine. This
mixture will be good for only twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>Tobacco spray will also destroy the large
red aphid (I call it this for want of, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the proper name) that has recently appeared
in some localities upon the stems of
the Rudbeckia (Golden Glow) and of the
single hardy Sunflower, just below the
blossom.</p>

<p>The enemy of the Box is the white spider.
The insect spins its web on the Box and
works from the inside. If the branches are
pulled aside, the inside of the plant will be
found full of dead leaves in the vicinity
of the web. Recently I read in a well-known
gardening monthly, that this spider
could be destroyed by spraying with kerosene
emulsion. I have some fine Box trees,
and there were several white spider-webs on
each. Watering with a very strong force of
water had been tried without effect. Upon
reading the article in the monthly and finding
that the spider was certainly causing
disaster which might be fatal, I proceeded
to have the trees sprayed with kerosene
emulsion, using it of the same strength as
for Roses. In fact, the sprayer was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
re-filled, as there was enough left in it since
last using it on the Roses. About three
days after the Box had been sprayed, large,
unsightly brown patches appeared on the
trees, showing that the emulsion had killed
the leaves wherever it touched them. The
spider was not harmed.</p>

<p>I mention this experience as an example
of the danger of taking all the directions
found in horticultural publications as gospel
truth. Nor should an amateur gardener ever
be tempted to trifle with plant medicines.
I have a certain friend whose affection for
her Roses is more profound than her knowledge
of how to treat their natural diseases.
Observing last summer that one of her most
cherished Crimson Ramblers was covered
with aphids, she concluded to spray it with
&#8220;something.&#8221; A bottle of carbolic acid being
most available, she tested its merits at once.
The efficacy of carbolic acid as a poison
was proved beyond a doubt, for the insects
became singularly dead in a day or two, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
so did the leaves; they fell off together.
There was nothing left but the forlorn stems
and branches, looking like some freak of the
vegetable kingdom.</p>

</div>

<p>It is of the greatest importance to have
a tool-room or closet according to the size
of the place, and to require all implements
to be kept there when not in actual use.
There should be shelves across one end or
side, where shears, trowels, garden cord, clippers,
watering-cans, mallet, various mixtures
for spraying, oil-cans, keys for turning on
the water, twine and all the smaller things
one uses, may be found at a moment&#8217;s notice.
Garden sticks painted green, in three sizes,
three and a half and four feet long, and
five-eighths of an inch in diameter, and
thicker ones an inch in diameter for Dahlias,
should be kept on hand in barrels.
They can be bought of lumber-dealers
in New York, where they are known as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
&#8220;dowels.&#8221; They come in bundles of one
hundred, costing from sixty cents to a
dollar and twenty-five cents a bundle, according
to size, unpainted, and the men
can paint them on rainy days. The lawn
mowers and the roller (which should be
a heavy one) can also be kept in the
tool-room. Rakes, both iron and wooden,
hoes, spades and shovels, the latter both
long-handled and short-handled, are best
kept hung up along one side of the closet,
where the men can see at a glance what
they want.</p>

<p>There should also be a pickaxe and a crowbar
for taking out refractory stones, and,
most necessary of all things in a garden,
the wheelbarrow should be kept here, too.
A sickle and a scythe must not be forgotten.</p>

<p>If the garden is large, a two-wheel tip-cart
will prove a great saver of labor in
carting manure and soil and in the removal
of debris.</p>

<p>On a particular shelf in my tool-room I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
keep my private trowel and flower scissors, to
which are attached long red ribbons as a
warning of &#8220;Hands off!&#8221; to others. There
is also a clipper which I often use in walking
about to trim a bit here and there from
a shrub or a climbing Rose.</p>

<p>If a scrap-book be kept, in which everything
of interest pertaining to the garden
can be pasted or written, it will be found a
great help. In this way items about fertilizers,
insecticides, special treatment of plants,
with copies of lists ordered, can be preserved,
and also, most interesting of all,
notes of when the different plants bloom
each year. I find the following under date
of October 18, 1901:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small">&#8220;To-day, though ice has formed three
times, I have filled nineteen vases with flowers.
They are Phlox, Larkspur, Monkshood,
Salvia, Nasturtium, Roses, Mignonette and
Chrysanthemums.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>After trying many kinds of gloves for
gardening, including the rubber ones, I now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
use only old Suede gloves; they give sufficient
covering and permit more freedom of
movement to the hands and fingers than
those of heavier material. It would be quite
impossible to transplant tiny seedlings while
wearing gloves with clumsy finger-tips.</p>

<p>Unless a woman possesses a skin impervious
to wind and sun, she is apt to come
through the summer looking as red and
brown as an Indian; and if one is often out
in the glare, about the only headgear that
can be worn to prevent this, is the old-fashioned
sunbonnet. With its poke before
and cape behind, protecting the neck, one
really cannot become sunburned, and pink
ones are not so bad. Retired behind its
friendly shelter, you are somewhat deaf to the
world; and at the distant house, people may
shout to you and bells be rung at you, and,
if your occupation be engrossing, the excuse
&#8220;no one can hear through a sunbonnet,&#8221;
must be accepted.</p>

<p class="center">CONCLUSION</p>

<p>The character of professional gardeners
seems to be changing. They have become
more perfunctory, more stubborn, more
opinionated, until now it is a really serious
question with them of &#8220;the danger of a
little knowledge.&#8221; To find a man who combines
sobriety and a good disposition with a
fair knowledge of his business and a real
liking for it, is a difficult matter. Where
but one man is kept to care for vegetables,
flowers and lawn, he is more than likely to
have little interest beyond potatoes or corn,
or to be good at raising small fruits, and to
consider everything else he has to do as so
much waste of time. When first married,
one of our gardeners was a German who
took no interest in flowers, and planted half
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the vegetable garden with &#8220;kohlrabi&#8221; and
&#8220;korn salad.&#8221; We had never heard of these
delicacies before, and did not care for them.
I remember also his telling me that one
kind of flower was enough to raise anyway.</p>

<p>If a young man with an elementary knowledge
of gardening can be found, who wants
to learn, is strong, willing and intelligent, it
is better to supply most of the brains yourself.
You will find your own wishes more
apt to be carried out than by the gardener
who &#8220;knows it all,&#8221; and seems to resent
what he calls &#8220;interference&#8221; on the part of
his employer.</p>

<p>I remember, when a child, seeing my
father&#8217;s gardener walking about in the early
evening after his supper, smoking a meditative
pipe, tying up Roses or spraying plants,
and often setting out seedlings after sundown.
He was never idle; he loved his
work and attended to it. But now it is rare
indeed to see a gardener, after hours, going
about his work; <i>autre temps autres m&oelig;urs</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Remember always that it is the overcoming
of the difficulties in the gardener&#8217;s way,
the determination to succeed, that gives zest
to the occupation. Did everything planted
grow and flourish, gardening would be too
tame. Rust and blight, cutworms, rose-beetles
and weeds, afford the element of sport
so attractive to us all. A lesson must be
learned from every failure; with renewed
patience persevere until success is reached.</p>

<p>I would make the strongest plea in favor
of a garden to all those who are so fortunate
as to possess any land at all. The
relaxation from care and toil and the benefit
to health are great, beyond belief, to those
who may have to work with head or hands.
If you can snatch a few minutes in early
morning or late afternoon, to spend among
the plants, life takes on a new aspect, health
is improved, care is dissipated, and you get
nearer to Nature, as God intended.</p>

<p>If the rich and fashionable women of this
country took more interest and spent more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
time in their gardens, and less in frivolity,
fewer would suffer from nervous prostration,
and the necessity for the multitude of sanitariums
would be avoided.</p>

<p>Flower gardening is pre&#235;minently a woman&#8217;s
occupation and diversion. Nearly every
great lady in England takes a personal interest
in her gardens and conservatories, and
knows all about the plants and flowers.
Here, the majority of women having large
places leave the direction of the flowers, as
well as the vegetables and fruit, to the taste
and discretion of the gardener, and thus miss
a great and healthful pleasure.</p>

<p>As a rule, young people do not care for
gardening. They lack the necessary patience
and perseverance. But in the years of middle
life, when one&#8217;s sun is slowly setting
and interest in the world and society relaxes,
the garden, with its changing bloom, grows
ever dearer.</p>
